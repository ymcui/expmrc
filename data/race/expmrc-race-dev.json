      "article": "C Teenagers are going to have lessons on how to sleep. Materials to teach teenagers how to get enough sleep will be offered to schools across Scotland. The teaching created by the charity Sleep Scotland is used to be part of curriculum. It aims to help people realize the importance of sleep for young people's physical and emotional health. The charity said watching TV and using computers and mobile phones at night can prevent teenagers getting the nine hours of sleep they need. Sleep Scotland, which also offers a sleep advising service, said getting enough sleep can improve grades and physical health. However, less sleep can be connected to being heavy and a greater risk of feeling upset and hopeless. Jane Ansell, leader of Sleep Scotland, said, “I don't think any parent would think of sending out their child without enough food in the morning, or beautiful clothing, and they know how important exercise is, so why should you send your child out without enough sleep?” The charity hopes to educate young people about why they need a full night's sleep and how to develop good sleeping habits. Kate Pearce, a teacher of guidance, said, “We see it more often at third year onwards. Pupils find it very difficult to get up in the morning and pay attention to their study. Sleep is most surely a problem.” Research shows that sleep time for teenagers around the world has decreased over the past 10 to 20 years. A report by the charity said young people often believed they could make up for sleep time during the week by sleeping late at weekends. However, by going to bed even later at weekends they were actually forcing a change in their body clocks, which would influence their study on Monday mornings.",

We all know that thinking green is sometimes the most difficult thing to do, but not impossible! Bed ZED, a new eco-friendly village in the south of London, has done a great job of providing its villagers with a high level living while getting them to pay more attention to protecting the environment. people in Bed ZED have done many things. They recycle their paper, plastic, glass and other daily things. They build many houses whose windows face south in order to get as much sunlight as possible. The rainwater is collected for use in the toilets. Also, the people there travel to work in shared cars or use public transportation if they work far away. Now, you may think it's not easy to live such a life, but let me tell you. it's not! It's a way of life. We just have to say no to what is bad for the environment, and begin working on ideas to protect it. Life would be much more pleasant if villages like Bed ZED existed all over the world! Thank you for listening!",

My biology teacher, Mr. Clark, divided us into three groups and asked us to play a game about natural selection and how birds find food. He gave the first group one spoon to every student, the second group forks and my group knives. I thought we were going hunting, so knives might work better. Surprisingly, he told us to pick up the beans on the grass with our spoons, forks or knives. When the game started all of us ran to the grass. We squatteddown and looked for beans. It was hard to pick up something that is small, especially from the grass. When I almost picked a bean, it dropped back to the ground. When I finally picked up several beans, one of my friends ran into me. I fell over. All my beans dropped to the ground! Just at that moment, Mr. Clark called us back. I had to leave the game and of course I got a bad result. I couldn't stop thinking that if I were a bird living on an island, I would be dead soon. The fun game made me realize that natural selection is really competitive. Everyone is trying his or her best to survive.",

Many of them can just get a call or a letter from their parents half a year, a year or even several years, which makes some children lost their parents' faces. When they meet their own troubles, they have no one to talk with. Nobody gives them enough care. Because of being too far away from their parents, the left-behind children's study is the second biggest problem. From a survey about their study, only two per cent of the children get good results, while ten per cent of them are common and eighty-eight per cent of them are poor. What a pity! There are also many other problems of the left-behind children, such as having no ability to protect themselves, unhealthy lifestyles, spending too much pocket money and being crazy about Internet and so on.

Get on a bicycle and ride around your neighborhood. You may discover something new all around you. Stopping and getting off a bike is easier than stopping and getting out of your car. You can bike to work and benefit from the enjoyable exercise without polluting the environment. You don't even have to ride all the way. Folding bikes work well for people who ride the train. Just fold the bike and take it with you. You can do the same on an airplane. A folding bike can be packed in a suitcase. You can also take a common bike with you when you fly. But be sure to look for information by getting on airline websites. Not all airlines are bicycle-friendly to travelers. Health Benefits of Bicycling: It helps to prevent heart diseases. Bicycling helps to control your weight. A 15-minute bike ride to and from work three times a week burns off five kilos of fat in a year. Bicycling can improve your mood . Exercise like bicycling has been shown to make people feel better, more relaxed and self-confident. Bicycling is healthier than driving.",

      "article": "Mostly we can drive a car safely on roads. But do you know that the colours of cars can influence the traffic safety in some ways? Some colours may make things worse, but other coulours can waken the bad situations when we meet traffic danger. The biggest automobile insurance company of Australia did a lot of studies. They found that cars in deep colours, such as black, grey and dark blue, have higher possibility to cause traffic accidents than bright light colours. Why? There may be two main reasons. Firstly, colours can be divided into forward colours and back colours. For example, there are four cars in colours of red, yellow, dark blue and black in front of you, and they keep the same distance from you. You will feel the red and the yellow cars seem to be nearer. That's because they are forward colours. They will remind drivers of dangerous situations earlier. However, the cars in dark blue and black seem to be farther. Both of them are back colours. They are easy to make things worse. Secondly, colours can also be divided into expanded colours and sinking colours. Cars in yellow or white seem bigger than its real size, so people will notice them more easily. Since cars in dark colours seem smaller than its real size, it's not easy for people to notice them, especially on rainy days or at nights.",

      "article": "I received pictures of my daughter floating on a lake in California. Right there under the sun during the hottest time of the day, she has only her swimsuit to cover her. When I showed it to my students, it was as if I had shown them scenes from a horror movie. “But she will get dark,” they said. “That's what she wants,” I told them. “We think darker skin is beautiful.” They looked at me in disbelief. It was as if I came from the moon. For years, American girls spend their summer trying to get as tanned as possible. In China, on the other hand, girls use umbrellas all year round. What in the world is going on? The pale skin we think looks unattractive is what Asian women want. Both groups want to meet their culture's standard of beauty. In the US, if you can afford to go on vacation in the summer, you head for a river, a lake or a beach, where you try to get as much sun as possible. If you are rich you take a winter vacation in some sunny spot. Your winter tan shows your wealth. In China, once upon a time, the few wealthy were the ones who didn't have to work out in the hot sun. So the whiter the skin, the richer the woman. The folk opera performers who play these ladies wore lots of white makeup. The tradition survives to this day. So it comes naturally that none of my students wishes to follow the Western ways in this regard. But now I am noticing that a new business – the tanning booth – started up in China. I admire those brave enough to define their own idea of beauty, but I do wonder what their grandmothers would have to say to them about it!",

After another two years on Englishtown, she's still studying in the online classroom. “Studying online is never boring, but you need practice, practice, practice!” Ellen says studying English isn't all about hard work. It should also be fun. “I really like the online conversation classrooms,” she says. “I have learned so much about other cultures and traditions.” Ellen has been able to put her English to use by visiting England five times! “I'm very thankful to Englishtown because my life has improved because of it,” Ellen says.",

      "article": "April will bring a new product – the Apple Watch – into the market. Last week, the watch was firstly introduced by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. The price of the watch will differ from $349 to $1,099, depending on its size, strap and whether it is a sports or regular version. Apple engineers and designers have put in a lot of thought and hard work into creating this \"small screen\" on your wrist. The \"sensor\" on the screen not only detects your finger, but knows the difference between when you are tapping, and when you are pressing harder. The watch also has “haptic feedback”. You can send personal messages to your friend, such as drawing a star or a special sign with your fingers, or tapping the watch, say 3 times, and your friend will receive those taps on their wrist. Besides telling the time, the watch will use 'bluetooth' to connect with your iPhone and show calls or text messages that come in. According to Tim Cook, the watch may open up a whole new area of applications that we had never thought of. Some car factories like BMW have developed an app that allows its car owners to open their cars with the watch. A 'Hotels' app may allow you to open the door to your hotel room without worrying about losing the smart-card. And finally, even airlines are jumping in--passengers may be able to simply wave their wrist to check into their flight. The biggest use of the watch, however, is as your personal fitness coach. The watch can measure your pulse (heartbeat) using a sensor at the bottom of the watch. It also has the same \"accelerometer\" as your iPhone, so it knows when you are moving, and also how much you are walking or running. It will remind you if you have been sitting for too long without much activity. Many stores ar e planning to stop selling the Nike, Jawbone and FitBit devices to welcome the Apple Watch. Will Apple Watch really replace these devices and make fitness much more fun?",

I didn't notice when Kevin ran up the stairs with hurt on his face. About 20 minutes later, as I was walking upstairs I heard Kevin crying inside the bathroom I knocked at the door and asked, “Hey, Kevin, do you want to talk?” No answer. I tried again, “Hey, why don't you come out of there?” Again, no answer. So I took a stack of cards and a pencil and wrote, “If you don't want to talk, we can write notes to each other.” An hour later I was still sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and the other was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his unpleasant feelings into words for me. When I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, “Nobody in this family cares about me, I'm not clever. Tommy thinks I'm a fool and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even notice me.” Tears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. It was true what he had said about me. I wrote back, “You know Kevin, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it to you.” There was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of cards wrote on a torn-up paper cup, “Thanks.” I wrote back “For what?” It returned to me with “loving me” written on it. After that, I try my best to never only half notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer relationship now, and sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset we'll smile and say “Write it on a paper cup.”",

In our house we never had enough money for a Christmas tree. After thinking for long,“Yes!” Dad finally said.“This year we will have a Christmas tree.” Our mouths opened wide at the thought of having our own tree. Then Dad said,“I'll do it myself.” We followed him around the house as he put all the materials together , We all sat close to him, carefully watching everything he did. He passed the thread around the first nail on the corner of a box, then back down to the second nail on the box, and up again to the nail, until right there before our eyes a green Christmas tree began to take shape. He carefully did the same with all of the 50 nails in the box and when he finished, he said,“Now you can decorate it.” I don't remember where the decorations came from, but they were red and small and to us they just looked so beautiful and nice for our tree. When we finished decorating it, we invited all our friends over to see our Christmas tree. We were so happy, because it looked so pretty and because my father made it himself. It truly was the most beautiful Christmas tree we had ever seen. Years later, things got better and Dad was able to buy a Christmas tree which we would happily decorate. However, my sisters and I will never forget the night when we got our first Christmas tree.",

      "article": "People are always afraid of making mistakes. But sometimes it's not bad to make mistakes, and here is why. At first, mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to try new things, because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try new things, how can you improve? How can you create? The simple answer is，“You can't.” Look around you, everything you see is the result of someone trying new things. Another good thing about mistakes is this: when you are making mistakes, you are learning. Consider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he invented the light bulb. When he was asked how he felt to fail that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work. Finally, when you make a mistake, you are that much closer to success. Why? Because you have said what you should say, and you have done what you should do. Every time you make a mistake, you are closer to success. But it doesn't mean that you can make mistakes without thinking. Instead, when you try new things you have to think them over, so that you can keep away from some unnecessary mistakes. We shouldn't spend all our time and money on the only one way, but use them correctly. Because our time and money are limited . There is an old saying, “If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough.” So go bravely and make mistakes. And learn. And grow. And succeed.",

He knew it was a long trip to where Love lived, so he got his things ready with some pizzas and drinks and started off. When he passed three streets, he saw an old woman sitting in the park and looking at some birds. She looked very hungry. The boy gave her a pizza. She took it and smiled at him. The smile was so beautiful that he wanted to see it again, so he gave her a Coke. She smiled once again. The boy was very happy. They sat there all the afternoon, eating and smiling, but they said nothing. When it grew dark, the boy decided to leave. But before he had gone more than a few steps, he turned around, ran back to the old woman and gave her a hug. The woman gave him her biggest smile ever. When the boy opened the door of his house, his mother was surprised by the look of joyon his face and asked what had made him so happy. “I had lunch with Love. She has got the most beautiful smile in the world.” At the same time, the old woman 's son was also surprised at his mother 's happiness and asked why. “I ate a pizza in the park with Love,” she said, “and he is much younger than I expected.” If the world is full of love, we can enjoy a better life.",

After the first week, I noticed that the food was eaten up very quickly. Then I began keeping an eye on my mum. To my surprise, I found that she would put some of the food into a paper bag and go out with it at about nine every morning. And finally, I decided to follow her. I saw her taking the food to the street children. She would also spend a lot of time talking and playing with them. One day, I talked to a neighbor and found out that my mum was well-known in the area. The children were very friendly with her and even thought of her as their own mother. Then it hit me – why wouldn't she want to tell me about it? Was she worried that I would stop buying food if I found out? When my mum got home, I gave her a big hug .I told her she didn't need to keep it a secret from me. And she told me something about the children. Some of them lived with an old lady in a small house. Others slept on the street. For years, she was helping the poor street children by giving them food. After she told me everything, I was so moved by how selfless she was. She helped others in need. As her son, I was so proud of my mum. I continued to buy food for my mum after that. But I always added one more bag for her other children.",

But how do you find real friendship and keep it? “The Care and Keeping of Friends” by American author Sally Seamans tells young students some smart ways to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed and take care of it to make it grow. First, you should choose a friend. What makes a good friend? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient. For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do their best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives. But things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to them. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter. Sally says there are three steps to being friends again: Tell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. The book also has advice on some small but important things like celebrating your friends' success. Even if you haven't had a real friend before, you will start to think of having one if you read this book. Because the book tells that friendship is the most important thing in your life.",

      "article": "We know that many animals do not stay in one place. Birds, fish and other animals move from one place to another at a certain time. They move for different reasons: most of them move to find food more easily, but some move to get away from places that are too crowded. When cold weather comes, many birds move to warmer to find food. Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed. The most famous migration is probably the migration of one kind of fish, which is called salmon. This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water. There it spends most of his life. When it is cold, it returns to its birthplace in fresh water. Then it gives birth and dies there. In northern Europe, there is a kind of mouse. They leave their mountain home when it becomes too crowded. They move down to the low land. Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside, and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea. Recently, scientists have studied the migration of a kind of lobster. Every year , when the season of the bad weather arrives, the lobsters get into a long line and start to walk across the bottom of the ocean. Nobody knows where they go. So, sometimes we know why humans and animals move from one place to another, but at other times we don't. Maybe living things just like to travel. ，。",

According to New York Times in 2015, some scientists want to invent mini-umbrellas which may reduce the global temperature. Building a single umbrella, which is big enough to cover the whole earth, seems to be impossible. Roger Angel, a scientist from the USA, has carried out a research to deal with this problem. He came up With an idea of mini-umbrella in 2014. In fact, each mini-umbrella is made up of two parts, a spaceship and a sunshade. A spaceship weighing about lg would carry a sunshade that is half a meter long. It would be mostly transparent. That means light can pass it directly to reach the earth, with lands and oceans clearly in view. The little spaceship can keep in certain position around the earth because of pressure, It's about 1.5 million kilometers away from the earth. They plan to send over 1,000 billion mini-umbrellas into space to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth. Scientists suggest the earliest launch could be in 2030. However, not all the scientists agree with the idea. Some suppose there should be easier and much cheaper ways to prevent the earth from getting to hot, such as to slow down the pollution people bring and to reduce the human activities. No matter what the result of the argument is, this idea of mini-umbrellas is certainly creative.",

I know her next trip back would be for my funeral .” “When you were saying goodbye I heard you say, ‘I wish you enough.' May I ask what that means?” He began to smile, “It's a wish that has come down from my great-great-grandparents. And my parents used to say it to me.” He stopped for a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it. He smiled even more. “When we said ‘I wish you enough,' we were wanting the other person to have a life full of enough good things.” Then, turning towards me, he shared the following “wish” from his heart. I wish you enough sun to keep you brigh. I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep you alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger. I wish enough hellos to get you through the final goodbye. My friends, I wish you enough.",

      "article": "C These days, morn and more Chinese people enjoy sending and receiving messages on the phone. It can help them to get the latest news and communicate with friends. But I think I should read more books besides the textbooks, the more, the better. It can open my eyes and improve my language skills. Of course, it also can help me to get good grades. Do you know how to read more and learn more? Here are some tips for you. ♦ Clear your purpose for reading Before you start reading, ask yourself why you are reading this book. Most people read for two main reasons, pleasure or knowledge. Clearing about your reading purpose can not only help you choose the books you really need to read, but also remind you why reading the book is important to you, so you will keep reading and complete the book faster. ♦ Read only what you are interested in No matter what you are reading, it is important to enjoy what you read. Your friends may tell you the books they love, but those books might not necessarily be the ones you enjoy. ♦ Give up books that you don't enjoy You may have chosen books that you are interested in, and they are right to your purpose. But while you are reading them, there may still be some books that you don't enjoy reading. Whenever you realize that you aren't enjoying the book you are reading, give it up. Remember reading shouldn't be a chore. ♦ Set a reading goal It is interesting that I read the books borrowed from libraries faster than those I bought. The reason is the books I bought don't have a due date! I don't need to return those books. Having a reading goal helps you work out how much reading you need to do in a week or even a day. Before you read each book, ask yourself what time you need to complete this book by.",

After many tries , she still failed. “ Maybe I can't reach the ocean,” she said sadly to herself. At this time, a deep voice said, “If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.” It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream answered, “That's because a breeze can fly, but I cannot.” “That's because you can't give up want you are. Let yourself evaporate into the breeze, and it can take you across,” said the desert. “ Give up what I am now? No! No!” The little stream could not accept this idea. “The breeze can carry the vapor across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again,” said the desert. “And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature never changes.” Hearing this, the little stream went into the open arms of the breeze.

I nodded, looking down at the stuff in my arms for valentine envelopes, I continued up the stairs. She was sitting with her hands folded in her lap. Her head was down and long and light-brown hair fell forward. When she raised her head, the smile on my face froze. The eyes in that sweet little girl's face were strangely empty. The bell rang. When the children came in, they looked at the valentine materials on my desk with excitement. I gave out materials and asked Kristie to offer help. In the office, my principal told me, “Several weeks ago, Mary's mother was killed before her. She hadn't cried or mentioned her mother since.” “But what can I do?” I felt so helpless. I returned to my room to discover that the children were shunning this “different” child. “She won't even try,” Kristie told me. On Valentine's Day, Mary's envelope dropped on the ground. She didn't take it home. She wore little for the rather cold weather. I sewed buttons on her thin coat, and the children brought caps, scarves, sweaters. In spite of our efforts, we seemed to be getting no closer to Mary. Even my faith was wearing thin. Then on a late March day, one of the boys excitedly reported a robin in the schoolyard. “Spring's here!” the children cried. “Let's make a flower border for the room!” Why not? I thought. Anything to lift our spirits, I showed the children how to make all the flowers we welcome in early spring. Remembering what happened on Valentine's Day, I expected nothing from Mary. But Suddenly, Kristie cried in surprise, “Come to see Mary's flowers. They're so pretty!” She looked at me with the shining eyes of any normal little girl, saying, “My mother loved flowers. She had all of these growing in our garden.”",

On the show, the five fathers and their children traveled around China, riding camels through the western deserts, fishing on the east coast, and selling vegetables for their bus fare home in southwestern Yunnan province. One dad doesn't know how to do his daughter's hair, so some people try to help him. Another one must survive with his son for three days in the desert, because the father can't cook, they only eat instant noodles. Why is Where Are We Going, Dad？so popular? Because it is about how Chinese parents look after their kids. The show makes modern parents think about what they should do with their kids. “In traditional Chinese culture, the father is strict and the mother is kind. But on the show, we see fathers who are much gentler on their kids and more involved in their growing.” said Li Minyi, a professor of early childhood education. In the past, children were taught to obey their parents' wishes and look after them in their old age. But today Chinese parents increasingly realize that respecting their children's choices may be a better way to prepare them for modern society. As they raise their children, parents are growing up at the same time.",

France French People usually do cheek kissing or handshaking to greet each other. If two friends meet, they kiss cheeks. But they're actually air kisses. They kiss each other on the cheek and make a kissing sound into the air. The number of kisses is different from place to place. If two people don't know each other well, they just shake hands. Japan Bowing is the most common way to greet other in Japan. Bows in Japan can different: from a small nod to a long bend. A deeper, longer bow shows more respect. Besides, Japanese people use a bow to say \"thanks\", \"sorry\", or to ask for a favor. Keep in mind that men and women bow differently. Men keep their bands at their sides. Women put their hands together on their thighs. Thailand In Thailand, people greet each other with the word \"sawatdi\". It means \"How are you?\" The word sawatdi is usually followed by \"kha\" when spoken by a female and by \"khrap\" when spoken by a male . At the same time, they put their palmstogether and bow slightly. It seems like a praying gesture. That's because most people in Thailand are Buddhists. If someone greets you with this gesture, you should reply in the same way.",

      "article": "C In a world of nearly 6,000 different languages, it is easy to get lost in translation. The further away from home you get, the more the languages around you change. But have you ever noticed any similarities? Language studies have shown that the words for “mama” and “papa” around the world are surprisingly similar. Scientists used to believe the words might be similar because many languages started from one language called Proto-Indo-European. Many languages currently spoken throughout Europe came from this language. In France, they say “maman” and “papa”, and in Norway, they say “mamma” and “papa”. So does this mean the first humans called their parents mama and papa? And does it mean those two warm words have lived through tens of thousands of years? Possibly, but this does not explain why there are similarities outside of Europe, such as “nanay” and “tatay” in the Philippines , which also appear in some Chinese dialects. So what could cause this similarity around the world? Russian-American linguist Roman Jacobson has a possible explanation. “If you're a baby trying to make a random sound, the easiest vowel is ‘ah' because you can make it without doing anything with your tongue or lips ,” Jacobson said. “M” and “n” are also created easily by opening and closing the mouth, so these sounds often develop next. In a similar way, the sounds closely related to father such as “p”, “d” and “t” develop when children play with the sounds available to them. This could be the reason why, around the world, a child's first words are often related to “ma” or “pa”, leading parents to be called “mama” and “papa”.",

      "article": "Who is the greatest teacher in Chinese history? Many people would think of Confucius, whose birthday was September 28. Although he lived over 2,000 years ago, people still remember and respect him for his contribution to the education today. Confucius lived in the Kingdom of Lu, which lies in Shandong Province. He lived during the Spring and Autumn Period. He had a hard childhood. His father died when he was only 3. His mother brought him up. As a child, he had to work to help his mother, but young Confucius didn't give up studying. He visited many famous teachers and learned music, history, poetry and sports. Later, he became a teacher and started the first public school in Chinese history. At that time only children from noble families could go to school, but Confucius believed everyone should go to school if they wanted to learn. He had about 3,000 students in his lifetime. Today, people still follow Confucius' lessons. He told us that we all have something worthy to be learned. “When I am with three people, one of them must be better than me in some areas. I choose their good qualities and follow them.” He also taught us that thinking is very important in study. “All study but no thinking makes people puzzled . All thinking but no study makes people lazy.” Confucius is not only a great teacher, but also a famous thinker with wise thoughts about the world and society. His most important teachings are about kindness and good manners. “A person should be strict with himself, but be kind to others.” he said.",

I was only three years old at the time. Before I was born，doctors were able to see that I had a heart defect—my heart couldn't do its job. I had my first heart surgerywhen I was three days old. More surgeries followed，and soon the doctors found they couldn't fix my heart. They had to get me a new one. So I got another child's heart. My surgery went well，and now here I am. Even ten years later，I'm doing great. 　　Well，it's not always easy. I see doctors regularly. Medicine is part of my everyday life. I had to have a surgery in 2008，and I may need more surgeries in the future. No one knows what will happen，and I don't worry about it. 　　I don't feel different from other people，mostly. I like violin，painting and ball games，and I'm in middle school. I have amazing friends. A few of them and I have been friends since I was a little child. I enjoy going to a special camp for kids with heart defects. The year I turned 11，I decided to get a swimsuit to wear at the camp. The camp helped me to be OK with showing my scars. 　　I celebrate my birthday and also my Heart Day，every February 17. It's a chance to be thankful for my new heart and the familythat gave it to me. I have never met the family，but I'd want them to know how thankful I am for my life.",

As a young child, Jane Goodall was interested in animals. She grew up in the English countryside and was always climbing trees or riding horses. When Jane was 23, she got a chance to go to Africa. Even though she had never been to college, she got a job with a famous scientist named Louis Leakey. One day Louis Leakey said he needed a volunteer. He needed someone to go to a lake in Tanzania to study a kind of chimpanzees. Jane was excited. On July 16, 1960, she began her exploration. At first, the chimpanzees ran away from Jane. But with time passing，they got used to her being around. Every day, Jane would follow the chimpanzees, taking notes on their behavior. She learned many new things about chimpanzees. She watched how a chimpanzee made a tool. She learned how some chimpanzees became good leaders. She watched how mother chimpanzees raised their children. She watched animals get angry and get upset. She wrote everything down so others would understand animals as she did. She learned that if you pay really close attention to animals, you will understand what they are “saying”.",

Then, he was chosen for the Chinese team at the Athens Olympic Games and won a gold medal. Liu Xiang was not a successful sportsman at first. He was born in Shanghai on 13th July 1983, and started training when he was very young. In Grade 4, he went to the Sports School of Putuo District of Shanghai. Liu was encouraged at first to train for the high jump. In 1998, Liu Xiang's ability in hurdling was noticed by Sun Haiping, who later became his coach. In 2001, a special programme was set up to help young sportsmen and sportswomen. Liu Xiang was among them. His races were recorded, and he was compared with the world's best sports stars. Sun Haiping used the information to change his training methods for Liu Xiang. In May 2001, Liu Xiang won his first international 110m hurdles race in Japan. In 2004, he won the first Olympic gold medal for China in the 110m hurdles race, and at the same time broke the Olympic Games record. It was also the first time an Olympic gold medal for hurdling was hung round the neck of a sportsperson from an Asian country. Liu Xiang trained very hard. In fact, he trained so hard that he hurt his foot. From 2008 on, he suffered a lot from his foot problem, but he did not give up. Though he missed some competitions, he still returned to first place in the world 110m hurdles race in 2012 It is a pity that his foot problem stopped him from completing the 2012 London Olympic Games. But he is still a symbol of courage and success, and we continue to take great pride in him.",

After supper, families take a walk along the bank of Dianchi Lake. The Golden Temple and EXPO Garden are two famous places of interest in the north of the city.

Suddenly a small opening appeared, and the butterfly made its great effort to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no further. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He cut off the remaining bit of the cocoon so that the butterfly could come out easily . But to his surprise, the butterfly got a heavy body and very small wings when it came out of the cocoon. The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that the body would grow smaller at any moment and the wings would become larger and be able to fly. But neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a heavy body and small wings. It was never able to fly. The man was in his kindness, but he did not understand the nature rules. Before the butterfly came out of the cocoon, fluid from its body must be forced into its wings, and then it would be ready for flying. It must have a hard struggle to get through the small opening to get its freedom from the cocoon. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If God allowed us to go through our life without any difficulties, it would make us fail. We would not be as strong as we could have been; we could never fly.",

But when you write one, send me a letter and let me know how much. There are some things we can always sell.” In four years all the checks I wrote were less than a thousand dollars. My part-time jobs such as reading to the blind students and helping other students with their studies filled in the financial gaps. “You know what you want to be, and they'll tell you what to take,” my father went on. “When you get a job, be honest and work hard.” I knew that soon I would be alone in the big town. Then my dad brought the old, broken Bible that he had read so often, the one he used when he wanted to look something up in a friendly argument with one of the neighbors. I knew he would miss it. I knew, though, that I must take it. He didn't ask me to read it every morning. He just said, “This can help you if you read it.” Did it help?

Two of the most important ingredients at that time were coca leaves and kola nuts－ and that's how the drink got its name. Pemberton sold the first glass on May 8, 1886 in Atlanta. But it tasted terrible, and as a result almost nobody wanted to buy it. In the first year, Pemberton only made $50 from it and the funny thing was that it cost him over $70. Later, businessman called Asa Candler wanted to make Coca-Cola a drink instead of a medicine. He mixed it with water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and it worked. Everybody wanted to buy it and in only a few years Coca-Cola became the national drink of the United States. The shape of the famous Coca-Cola bottle was created in 1915 by Earl R. Dean. During the Second World War American soldiers drank three million bottles of Coca-Cola a day! They helped to spread the name and the taste of drink all over the world. Today, nearly 300 million bottles are drunk every day all over the world.",

Like a planet, a comet has no light of its own. It shines from the sunlight it reflects . Like the earth, a comet goes round the sun, but on a much longer path than the earth travels. If a comet isn't a star, what is it then? Some scientists think that a large part of a comet is water frozen into pieces of ice and mixed with iron and rock dust and perhaps a few big pieces of rock. When sunshine melts the ice in the comet, great clouds of gas go trailing after it. These clouds, together with the dust, form a long tail. Many people perhaps have seen a comet. However no one knows how many comets there are. There may be millions of comets, but only a few come close enough for us to see. An Englishman named Edmund Halley, who lived from 1656 to 1742, found out a lot about the paths that comets take through the sky. Some comets move out of our sight and never come back. Others keep coming back at regular times. A big comet that keeps coming back was named after Halley because he was the one who worked out it would come back every seventy-six years again. Maybe you have ever seen Halley's Comets because the last time it came close to the sun and the earth was in the year 1986. Then people all over the world were outside at night to look at it. You will probably be able to see Halley's Comets when it comes near the earth again.",

The Loch Ness Monster is a famous legend.The first story about a monster in Loch Ness was told over 500 years ago,but the legend of the monster spread widely only in the twentieth century.In 1933,a husband and wife reported that they saw a big monster in the middle of the lake.Sincethen,a number of people have said that they have seen a monster in Loch Ness.Several people have taken photos,but at least one of them was a hoax.During the 1960s,a team was formed to look for the monster.They took many photos and made movies,but they were never able to find a monster. There is no real fact that a monster lives in Loch Ness,but there is also no fact that one doesn't live.One thing is true about Loch Ness:there are a lot of tourists there.",

The ninth-grader from Hunan feels bad about her weak subjects. She sometimes comforts herself : “ That happens to every arts person. I'll choose the liberal arts after I enter senior high school.” But now she will not have that choice. On Nov 15, the government announced a series of reforms. One of them is about the college examination system. It says that aims are to cultivateall-round students. One of the plans is to stop dividing senior high school students into liberal arts and science classes. Zhang Zhiyong, Guo's physics teacher, welcome the change. “High school students are not asked to learn very professional knowledge. So they should do well in all the useful subjects,” he said. Our society needs all-round people. “The reform meets the needs of both students and the development of China's higher education,” said Xiong Bingqi, deputy head of the 21st Century Education Research Institute. Does that mean students will face more tests before entering college? “There will be fewer examination subjects,” says the document. Also, the examination system will be reformed. According to the new one, students will be evaluatedby both their final exam scores and their school performance. So far, the reforms are only a plan. It's unknown when they will be carried out. “Anyway, I will not give up on any subject now,” said Guo Langjie.",

If you go to sleep on your back, you're a very open person. You normally trust people and you are easily influenced by new ideas. You don't like to make people unhappy, so you never express your real feelings. You're quite shy and you aren't very confident. If you sleep on your stomach, you are a person who likes to keep secrets. You worry a lot and you're always easily becoming sad. You never want to change your ideas, but you are satisfied with your life the way it is. You usually live for today not for tomorrow. If you sleep on curled up, you are probably a very nervous person. You have a low opinion of yourself and often protect yourself from being hurt, so you are very defensive. You're shy and you don't usually like meeting people. You like to be on your own. If you sleep on your side, you have usually got a well-balanced personality. You know your strengths and weaknesses. You're usually careful. You have a confident personality. You sometimes feel worried, but you don't often get unhappy. You always say what you think, even if it makes people angry.",

During his twenty years as a writer, the father of four became worried about illiteracy in America and decided to do something about it. Davidson started “Bookcase for Every Child” project in his hometown of Conway, Arkansas, USA in 2005. The project provides low-income children with bookcases, and a starter set of books to encourage reading. Davidson's project is different from other projects. Instead of raising money from the public, he gets many people personally to take part in the project. “We decided to build 50 bookcases each year and give them to low-income children,” said Davidson. “I can promise you this is the nicest piece of furniture in most of these low-income children's homes.” Today, the project has spread to eight communities in five states. He said the project's early success belonged to the community members. “I knew a lot of people all over the community and was able to choose a group of people to do the job,” said Davidson. The group included members such as librarians and a workman. Davidson's love for the project grew deeper after his wife died in May, 2013. For him, spreading the bookcase project all over the country is the best way to remember her. And he hopes to have at least one project in every state in his country. 。",

      "article": "Shopping on the Internet is becoming more and more popular. Why do people use the Internet to shop? Some people say it is more convenient. They don't have to leave their homes to order something; they can shop for anything they want at any time; they can find things for sale that they can't find in the Mores near their homes. Still other people say they can find better prices on the Internet If you want to buy something on the Internet, you need a credit card. You have to type your credit card number and information on the website and send them to the store over the Internet. You have to be sure that the store will not use your information in the wrong way. You don't want someone to get your credit card number, so be careful with it, because people sometimes steal credit card numbers from stores. TV Internet is also a good place to go window-shopping. Window-shopping is when you look at the things for sale in a store, but don't plan to buy anything. In window-shopping you can see what kinds of things you are able to get and how much they cost. Some stores like Ross Stores have a website for information about their Mores, but not for shopping. Some stores have a website for information about their stores, and you can shop on line there, such as Office Depot, Payless Shoe Source. Safeway. Some stores like Amazon.com are only for on line shopping",

There is some simple advice to help you look after yourself and others during hot weather. Listen to the weather report. If you know a heat wave is on the way you can plan ahead to reduce the risk of ill health from the heat. Keep out of the heat - If you can, don't go out in the hottest part of the day (11am -3pm). If you must go out, stay in the shade. Stay cool - A cloth or scarf on the back of the neck can help. Keep windows closed while the room is cooler than it is outside. Open them when the temperature inside rises, and at night for ventilation. Drink often - Even if you're not thirsty - water and fruit juice are best, avoid coffee and hot drinks. Ask for advice - call your doctor or someone else if you are worried about your health during a heat wave, especially if you are taking medicine. Helping others -If anyone you know is likely to be at risk during a heat wave, help them get the advice they need. Older people living on their own should be visited every day to see if they are OK.",

      ],
      "article": "Stephen Hawking was born in Oxford, England on 8th January, 1942. He went to school in St Albans---a small city near London. Although he did well, he was never top of his class. After leaving school, Hawking went first to Oxford University where he studied physics, then he went to Cambridge University where he studied cosmology. As he himself admits, he didn't work hard. He was a very lazy student, and did very little work. However, he still got good marks. It was at the age of 20 that Hawking first noticed something was wrong with him. He started to bump into things. When he visited his family at Christmas time, his mother was so worried that she made him see a doctor. Hawking was sent to hospital for tests. Finally, the result came back. Hawking had motor neurone disease, an incurable illness which would make him unable to speak, breathe or move without the help of a machine. Doctors said they had no way to help him. He would die before he was 23. At first, Hawking became very depressed. After a while, though, he began to see his life in a different way. As he later wrote, \"Before my illness was diagnosed, I had been very bored with life. There had not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do.\" Hawking married, found a job at Cambridge University, and had three children. He also went on to do some of the most important scientific research. Today, Hawking still works at Cambridge University as a professor. He strongly believes that his story shows that nobody should lose hope. \"Life is not fair,\" he once said. \"You just have to do the best you can in your own situation.\"",

In fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. An d when you do something good to others, you will feel happy, too. All these are your happiness. If you notice them, you can see that happiness is always around you. Happiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you cannot always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a revolving door. When it closes, it also opens. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy and lucky person.",

She has a passion for helping people, especially children. This summer, she saw some kids on the street and had nothing to eat. The ways they suffered from hunger deeply sadden her. In Klock's mind, kids should grow up and study happily. So she decided to do the best she could, to collect food for the children. She put boxes at the stores and her home respectively . So when people passed the store or her home, they could put some food in the box. Her project didn't have a name, but she likes to emphasize “Hunger Hero” with her food drive. That's what she wrote on her poster that accompanies the box. However, in the beginning, Klock was not welcomed by some stores. They turned her down when she wanted to place her box in their store. But after Klock explained her reasons, they were glad to offer a helping hand. “Hunger exists everywhere in the world, even around us. It could be our neighbor, a teammate or a classmate,” said Klock. “I believe I can influence others to do it together with me, because that's how we can make a difference, whether in my community or the whole world.”",

To a person, maybe you know his or her sex, name, birthplace and many other things, but it is very difficult to know yourself. Knowing yourself means accepting yourself and not worrying about what other people think about you. This is the key to a happier life. Read the following examples first. I'm Simon, 16 years old, from Guang Ming Middle School. I'm born clever. I'm good at math, so my teacher often praises me in class. My dream is to be a scientist, but the fact is that I can't pay attention to a thing for a long time. Recently, I've felt bored with myself. Teachers and my best friends have given me some advice on it. They told me to be confident with myself and not to lose heart. Could you tell me what else should I do next? I'm Wang Fang, a girl from Sunshine Middle School. I want to be a doctor, because I want to be a volunteer to save people's lives in Africa. I work hard on my lessons and try to get a high grade in every exam. Last week, I had a test on spoken English, and I made lots of mistakes because of carelessness. That made me unhappy and cry for a whole day. Now my parents have no ways to help me about my failure . My English teacher only said “Gold can't be pure and man can't be perfect”, but I can't understand it. Now I really need your help. Could you give them some advice? Well, your dreams mainly depend on your inner personalities , and the quality of your life is reflecting them. Learn to know yourself by developing a strong and confident connection with your inner strength.",

They are far outpaced by Australians, Asians and Europeans who walk much more, according to a study. Adults in western Australian average 9,695 steps a day. The Swiss followed with 9,650, while the Japanese clocked in with 7,168 steps. But Americans dropped far behind with just 5,117 steps. “We were surprised that the levels of physical activity were that low,” said Dr. David R Bassett, of the University of Tennessee, “Five thousand steps are really pretty inactive,” he added. Bassett said Americans need to step up for another 30 to 40 minutes a day to make the fitness gap small. One mile equals about 2,000 steps. The researchers used pedometers to gather step data from 1,136 US adults, who were in different ages, genders and geographic locations, and compared the results to similar studies in the other countries. Bassett thinks US car culture and lack of plenty of public transportation provide rich ground for couch potatoes. “People do have to exercise, but our overall environment does not lend itself to improving an active lifestyle.” He attributes(...) the more active lifestyle of adults in other countries to their greater use to lots of traffic. “In Switzerland you might get enough activity just in the course of doing your jobs,” he explained. The drive-not-walk mentality has bad influences. In the US, 34% of adults are overweight. During the past decade, Australia, Japan and Switzerland have reported overweight rates of 16%, 3% and 8%. Bassett said research has shown that just putting one foot in front of the other can help prevent weight gain. “Even modest amounts of walking on a daily basis can help you to maintain a healthy body weight,” he said.

Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides. We put turbines into the mouth of the river. Then the tide comes in, the water turns the turbines and then it goes out, it turns them again. Which of these ways will be used to run our cars in the future?",

Neither you could find gold, nor would you ever find its end. No matter how far you run, it always seems far away. A rainbow is not a thing which we can feel with our hands as we can feel a flower. It is only the effect of light shining on raindrops. The raindrops catch the sunlight and break it up into all the wonderful colours which we see. It is called a rainbow perhaps because it is made up of raindrops and looks like a bow. That is why we can never see a rainbow in a clear sky. We see rainbows only when there is rain in the air and the sun is shining brightly through the clouds. Every rainbow has many colours in the same order.

Each student is tested on three sports. They can choose long jump, basketball dribbling or volleyball. The pull-up is for boys and girls can choose the sit-up. Both boys and girls must skip in the test. Most students find the test easy and more than 90％of them can get full marks. That's because they have been training for it during the three whole years. Students in Junior Three usually do lots of practice in P.E. classes. The training makes the test easier than it seems to be. Students in Nanjing don't need to run a lot for the test, but students in Beijing must do lots of running for the test. Running is one of the sports in test. So in P.E. classes, they usually run a lot. Sometimes they have to run 3,000 meters in one class. Most teachers and parents welcome the P.E. test.

      "article": "Some time ago I discovered that one of my chairs had a broken leg. I didn't think there would be any difficulty in getting it repaired, as there are a lot of antique shops near my home. So I left home one morning carrying the chair with me. I went into the first shop expecting a friendly reception. I was quite wrong. The man wouldn't even look at my chair. The second shop, though slightly more polite, was just the same, and the third and the fourth -- so I decided that my approach must be wrong. I entered the fifth shop with a plan in my mind. I placed the chair on the floor and said to the shopkeeper, \"Would you like to buy a chair?\" He looked it over carefully and said,- \"Yes, not a bad chair. How much do you want for it, sir?\" “Twenty pounds,\" I said. “OK,\" he said, \"I'll give you twenty pounds.\" “It's got a slightly broken leg,\" I said. ‘'Yes, I saw that, it's nothing.\" Everything was going according to my plan and l was getting excited. \"What will you do with it?\" I asked. “Oh, it will be easy to sell once the repair is done.\" “I'll buy it,\" I said. “What do you mean? You've just sold it to me,\" he said. \"Yes, I know but I've changed my mind. I am sorry. I'll give you twenty-seven pounds for it.\" “You must be crazy,\" he said. Then, suddenly the penny dropped. “I know what you want. You want me to repair your chair.\" “You're right,\" I said. \"And what would you have done if I had walked in and said, 'Would you repair this chair for me?\"' “I wouldn't have agreed to do it,\" he said. \"We don't do repairs, not enough money in it and too much trouble. But I'II repair this for you. Shall we say for five pounds?\" He was a very nice man and was greatly amused by the whole thing.",

But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes？ According to a study，half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an averageof two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from short-sightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes.When looking at something in the distance,your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However，when you look at things closer to your face，the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes.Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep.If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger，too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma. While you're probably not going to stop using your smartphone，there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes.Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. Take a break every hour and try the following:look at something at least five meters away from you and then focus on the tip of your nose.Repeat this several times.It can reduce the discomfort in your eyes.",

      "article": "When I was a kid in Minnesota, watermelon was expensive. One of my father's friends, Bernie, was a rich businessman, who owned a large store in St. Paul. Every summer, when the first watermelons arrived, Bernie would call. Dad and I would go to Bernie's place. We' d sit on the edge of the dock, feet dangling, and got ready for a big meal. Bernie would take his knife, cut our first watermelon, hand us both a big piece and sit down next to us. Then we'd bury our faces in watermelon, eating only the heart—the reddest, juiciest, firmest, sweetest, most seed-free part—and throw away the rest. Bernie was my father's idea of a rich man. I always thought it was because he was such a successful businessman. Years later, I realized that it was not Bernie's wealth itself but his way of dealing with it that my father liked. Bernie knew how to stop working, get together with friends and eat only the heart of the watermelon. What I learned from Bernie is that being rich is a state of mind. Some of us, no matter how much money we have, will never be free enough to eat only the heart of the watermelon. If you don't take the time to dangle your feet over the dock and enjoy life's small pleasure, your work is probably hurting your life. For many years, I forgot that lesson I'd learned as a kid on the loading dock. I was too busy making all the money I could. Well, I've relearned it. I hope I have time left to enjoy the success of others and to take pleasure in the day. That's the heart of the watermelon. I have learned again to throw the rest away.",

      "article": "Have you noticed your life becoming a little easier? Now, when you go to a certainshopping mall, you can enjoy its free Wi-Fi there. When you want to take a taxi, you can book one with your phone. In fact, all these can be seen as the basic parts of a smart city. The idea of a smart city was brought up by US company IBM in 2010. Generally, a smart city is a city that uses digital technologies such as the Internet to improve city planning, save money and resources, and make our life convenient. How smart can a city be? Here are great examples that we can learn from. In 2009, Dubuque became the first smart city in the US. The city used smart water meters to take the place of traditional water meters. They can detect water waste and leakage and send data to let the house owner know. The same system is used for other city resources like electricity and natural gas. This way, people know how they use their resources and are glad to help reduce waste. Santander in Spain also gives us a look at the future. If people point a phone toward a nearby bus stop, the phone immediately shows all bus lines that serve the stop as well as their arrival times. The government organized a research team and provided an App that collects data on almost everything: light, temperature, and the movements of cars and people. Opening the App near a supermarket provides immediate information on special offers.",

However, many people believe that the smell of food and drink would influence other passengers. What's more, eating and drinking could cause problems between passengers. Li Wenjie, and official with Beijing subway Line 8, told China Daily that many people fell because they stepped on food or drink on the floor. The debateis heard around the world. In some countries, such as Singapore, people caught eating or drinking on the subway can be fined up to 500 Singapore dollars. While in many countries such as Italy and the UK, there is not clear rule that eating is not allowed , however, few people would do so. “If someone ate something with a strong smell such as hamburger on the subway, passengers would look at the person oddly ,” said Ren Sicong, a Chinese student in Milan, Italy. So how can we create a more pleasant environment on the subway? People should behave well. Besides not eating strong-smelling food, we can do more: don't talk loudly: use earphones to watch video and listen to music: get on and off the subway in line. And social media should also play its role, Beijing News said.",

      "article": "Are some people born clever, and others born stupid? Or is intelligence developed by our environment and our experience? Strangely enough, the answer to these questions is yes. In some degree, our intelligence is given to us at birth, and no education can make a talent out of a child born with low intelligence. On the other hand, a child who lives in a boring environment will develop his intelligence less than one who lives in rich environment. Therefore, the limits of person's intelligence are fixed at birth, whether or not he reaches those limits will depend on his environment. This point of view, now is held by most experts. It is easy to show that intelligence is something that we are born with. The closer the blood relationship between two people, the closer they are likely to be intelligence. If we take two strangers by chance from the population, it seems that their degree of intelligence will be completely different. If, on the other hand, we compare two twins, they will very likely be as intelligent as each other. Relations like brothers and sisters, parents and children, usually have similar intelligence, and this clearly suggests that intelligence depends on birth. Imagine now that we take two twins and put them in different environments. We might send one, for example, to a university and the other to a factory separately where the work is boring. We would soon find differences in intelligence developing, and this shows that environment as well as birth plays an important role. This conclusion is also suggested by the fact that people who live in close contact with each other, but who are not related at all are likely to have similar degree of intelligence.",

Your mother has to save the family's shower water to use for washing clothes. Then she has to use that same dirty water to wash other things. Would you be able to stand that kind of life? Probably not. But that's what kids in Yemen are experiencing. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water. According to a World Bank report, the capital, Sana, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025. Because of the water shortage in Yemen, the government often cuts the water supply. Hannan, an 18-year-old from Lahej，told the Times, “In a good week we'll have a water supply all week. But then the following week there will be water only for a day or two.” Hannan said only rich people have enough water to use. They can buy water from the shops or from the water trucks. Private companies own the trucks. They travel around the city every day to sell water--- at very high prices. “A lot of people can't afford it,” she said. The average person in Yemen uses 100 to 200 cubic meters of water per year. That is far below the international water povertyline of 1,000 cubic meters. The government is thinking of making use of sea water. But it will cost a lot and it may not happen soon enough to help the people of Yemen.",

The following are some of the most important rights of children: Children have the right to be properly fed, clothed and sheltered by their family. If their family can't do so, the government should take responsibility. Children have the right to an education and medical care, which should be provided by the government. Children must not be cruelly punished by their parents or any others. Children have the right to expect the government to protect them from all kinds of abuse and neglect. No child under fifteen should be made to fight in an army. Children have the right to be protected from being made to work too hard to make money for other people. In some countries children do not have these rights. Many young children are made to work long hours in factories and on farms. In some countries there are so few schools that only rich children get an education. There are not enough doctors or nurses to help many children when they are sick. The rights of children are, therefore, the rights people think children should have. They are not always the rights children really have.",

      "article": "Charles Chaplin was born in London on April 16, 1889. His parents were music hall actors. The Chaplin family were very poor, and life was difficult in London. Charlie, as he was called, used to do his mother's job in the theatre when she was ill. When he was only 17 years old, Chaplin got his first real job as an actor. What he did was to do silly things to make people laugh in the theatre. Seven years later he went to the USA. And over the next four years, he formed his own way of art. He developed the character of a homeless gentleman which became very popular. From the 1920s to the 1950s, Chaplin made his most famous films. The film Modern Times (1936) shows his care about the modern industry workers. Many of his films describe the poor life and hard time of the working people during that period. Although Charlie Chaplin was British, he lived in the USA until 1953. But he never got US nationality. Then Chaplin, his wife and his five children had to move to Switzerland where he lived until he died. When he was 83 years old, he won his only Oscar for the music he wrote for the film Limelight. He was named Sir Charles Chaplin at the age of 85. Charlie Chaplin died in Switzerland on December 25th, 1975.",

      "article": "In the West, some people believe that personality can be influenced by the time of the year the person was born. Chinese also believe that the year of birth influences one's personality. In the past century, a new belief has arisen: the idea that personality is related to one's ABO blood type. People with blood type A, for example, are considered more probably to be serious, hard-working, and quiet, while people with blood type O are probably to be popular and outgoing, yet often unable to finish what they start. Though this belief continues to be strong, some people question if it is true. The blood-type personality theory started in Japan in 1927 when Furukawa Takehji noticed personality similarities and differences among his workers. The idea soon went out of fashion, but was brought back by a Japanese television host named Toshitaka Nomi in the 1970s. The belief is still strong in Japan and is increasingly popular in neighboring countries. Such as Korea. Some young Koreans have taken to the theory. A recent study showed 76 percent of Koreans aged between13 and 64 believing in the blood-type personality connection. Though most Asians might believe in the blood-type theory, for many it seems harmless and not something to be taken too seriously. There is also the possibility that people are influenced to change their personality to match the expected stereotypes. A survey of studies made in Japan over 10 years found that while in the 1970s there was no relationship between blood type and personality, later studies in the 1980s found that the relationship increased a little. Researchers conclude that as the belief in the stereotypes increases, people may be changing their personality to follow the blood-type theory. Is the belief true? The scientists in Asia largely dismiss the belief as a modern-day superstition . Most studies have failed to find any strong connection between blood and personality. Generally, scientists warn against making predictions or important decisions based on this questionable theory.",

These non-verbal signals will help you a lot, but you still need to focus on what people are saying. If you focus too much on their body language signals, you and the person may feel uncomfortable. It is useful to be able to read people's body language, but it is useful to learn how to send the right signals and avoid the wrong signals too. Body language may be given several interpretations.

The study shows that people who eat at least three, apples a day lose weight. (4) Stand up and walk around Every time you use the mobile phone, stand up and walk around. Heavy people sit on average two and a half hours more each day than thin people. This skill is very important as standing up and walking around will burn 50 or more calories. Use these skills, and you will have a big weight loss. ，A、B、C、D，。(5，2，10)",

One night, just before Christmas, I found a large black wallet on the floor near one of the tables. I guessed I should check it to find out who was the owner, but I was very busy at the time. And I imagined that if there was something valuable in the wallet, the owner would be back. Sure enough, an hour later a man came up to the counter and asked if anyone had found a wallet. I asked him to describe the lost wallet, and after he described it exactly, I gave him the wallet. He expressed his thanks when I handed it to him. He asked me if I had opened it, and when I told him “no”. At once he opened it and showed that it had nearly $ 800 in cash. He took out a twenty-dollar bill and handed it to me and I was amazed at this. “A reward for your honesty,” he said and then turned and walked away. Thinking about it later, I began wondering whether I would have been honest if I had known what was in the wallet! I thought that if I had no way to find the owner and no one returned to get it, I might keep it. But it also came into my mind that I actually saved someone's Christmas plans by finding and returning the wallet. The good feeling it gave me was worth more than anything could buy.",

      "article": "Childhood is a time of fun and games. Many people still remember when they were young, they often played games like hide-and-seek and chess. Playing teaches children how to get along with others, and it also helps to exercise the mind and body. However, children today spent most of their playing time in front of the computer, playing video games. A recent survey found that in the US children between 8 and 12 spent at least 13 hours a week playing videogames or \"gaming\". Boys of this age spend even more time, almost 16 hours a week. Although some people will say that gaming is helpful, it brings many problems as well. One big problem is that kids who spend most of their time on games might have difficulty communicating with real people. They might have trouble sharing and resolving problems because they do not practice these skills when sitting alone at a computer. Another problem is about health. Game players usually sit for hours without doing any exercise. And they might not eat healthily. As a result, they might be out of shape. Next, game players might have trouble with their lessons. Many of them spend more time playing games than working on their homework. In the end_______. Finally, it is always possible that the gamers become addicted. Some people play four or five hours a day or even all day. This happened to a 28-year-old Korean man. He spent about 50 hours playing an online game without sleeping or eating well. He died while gaming! This is one example of the dangers of video gaming. It tells us that video gaming, like everything else, should not be done too much. A few hours a week should not hurt, but several hours a day just might be dangerous to your health.",

About halfway there, the car ran over a nail and we got a flat tire . Luckily we had one more at the back of the car, but it took a long time to change the tire.

After lunch that day Grandma said, “Susan, let's wash the dishes.” But Susan said, “Grandma, Tom told me he wanted to help in the kitchen today, didn't you, Tom?” And then she whispered to him, “Remember the duck?” So Tom did the dishes. Later Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go fishing, but Grandma said, “I'm sorry but I need Susan to help clean the house.” But Susan smiled and said, “Well, that's all right, because Tom told me he wanted to help.” and she whispered again, “Remember the duck?” So Susan went fishing with Grandpa and Tom stayed. These “remember the duck” went on for many days. Then finally Tom couldn't stand it any more. He came to Grandma and told her that he had killed the duck. She gave him a hug, and said, “Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing. But because I love you, I forgave you. But I just wanted to see how long you would let Susan make a slave of you. ”",

      "article": "A small piece of fish each day may keep the heart doctor away. That's the finding of an extensive study of Dutch men in which deaths from heart disease were more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least an ounce of saltwater fish per day compared to those who never ate fish. The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific support to the long --held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States, with more than 550,000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year. But previous research has shown that the level of heart disease is lower in cultures that consume more fish than Americans do. There are fewer heart disease deaths, for example, among the Eskimos of Greenland, who consume about 14 ounces of fish a day, and among the Japanese, whose daily fish consumption averages more than 3 ounces. For 20 years, the Dutch study followed 852 middle-aged men, 20 percent of whom ate no fish. At the start of the study, average fish consumption was about two-thirds of an ounce each day, with more men eating lean fish than fatty fish. During the next two decades, 78 of the men died from heart disease. The fewest deaths were among the group who regularly ate fish, even at levels far lower than those of the Japanese or Eskimos. This relationship was true regardless of other factors such as age, high blood pressure, or blood cholesterollevels.",

      "article": "C Imagine a stranger walking past you on a cold, rainy day. “Lovely weather, isnˈt it?” the stranger says. Do you laugh, or even smile? If not, you may not have a dry sense of humor. British people, and particularly the English, are well-known for our dry sense of humor. We often say the opposite of what we mean in order to be funny, and tell jokes in a tone of voice that makes it sound like we are being completely serious. As US writer Julian Tan put it on the HuffPost Students blog: “It is as if it is ˈOpposite Dayˈ every day in Britain.” If the people of Britain are known for having a “stiff upper lip” and not showing emotion, then our dry sense of humor shows this through jokes. Often it will take a long time or several beers to get a British person to tell you what they actually think about something and get behind the wall of humorous sarcasm that they have in front of them. English comedian Ricky Gervais put it like this: “We play jokes on our friends. We use sarcasm as a shield and a weapon. We avoid being serious until itˈs absolutely necessary.” It can be annoying and confusing if you havenˈt been raised with these types of jokes: “Why did he just say such a ridiculous thing? Is he making fun of me?” But it is also true that understanding this type of humor is a good way to make friends with people in the UK, even if you donˈt find it funny. Itˈs important to remember that the person telling the joke may actually be making fun of himself or herself, not you. One of the characteristics of British humor is “its strong theme of self-deprecation” (making fun of oneself), according to Tan. So donˈt worry – often, English people, and British people in general, just want to make fun of themselves!",

My mother stared at him and said to him angrily: “You should learn to give the good things to others; you shouldn't always think of yourself.” Seeing this, I suddenly changed my idea and then said to my mother: “Mum, please give me the smaller one and give the bigger one to my little brother.” Hearing my words, my mother was very happy. She kissed me on my face and gave the reddest and biggest apple to me as a prize. From then on, I learned to tell lies, fight, steal and rob. In order to get what I wanted, I played hard. As a result, I was sent into prison. The famous man from the White House said: One day, my mother brought some apples. She said to my brother and me: “You all want the reddest and biggest one, right? Well, let's have a competition. Now I divided the grassland in front of the gate into two and I will give one to each of you and you must shear it well. And I will give the reddest and biggest apple to him who does it the most quickly and best.” After the competition, I won and I got the biggest apple. In our family, as long as you want to get the best things, you must take part in competition. I think it is fair. No matter what you want, you must pay lots of efforts.",

      "article": "D When you watch TV programs about wild animals, it is surprising to see how an antelope can escape a lion's attack. In the wilderness, everyone has a stunt. Even plants have their own ways of fighting off enemies. Over millions of years of evolution, plants have developed a unique defence system. Chemicals are widely used for survival. By making their leaves, flowers, roots and fruits poisonous to enemies, plants can fight back. One such plant is the Golden Wattle tree, British scientist David Caneron has found when an animal eats the tree's leaves, the amountof poison increase in the other leaves. “It's like the injured leaves telephoning the others telling them to fight together against the enemy,” he said. The tree also sends defence messages to neighboring plants by giving out a special smell. Golden Wattle trees in the nearby 45 meters will get the message and produce more poison within 10 minutes. Now, if an enemy eats too many of the trees' leaves, it will die. Every species of plant or tree is good at producing a special set of chemicals. A herbivore that can safely eat the leaves of one tree may be poisoned by its neighbor. In this way, plants have developed not only their own defence system, but also shared with others. This makes it impossible for a single animal to destroy even a small area of forest.",

      "article": "Before I had my son, I spent two years working with children with disabilities. I learned that shouting and threats of punishment would result in a disaster. Coming up against their behaviour could only make the job harder and their behaviour more extreme. I found something that worked, though. There was a very naughty boy in the nursery and a teacher who was generally very confident with the children was asked to take charge of him. One day the boy joined a session in the room next to mine. His appearance created an atmosphere of tension. He spent the entire session running around, hitting and kicking, and destroying property. I was in the craft room working with some other children when my co-worker told me that this boy's teacher was in tears, and could not get control of the situation. As we were talking，the boy ran in. I told my co-worker that I would take care of him. I closed the door. He was full of energy, throwing things around and making a huge mess. But I could see that he was doing all these to annoy me. He needed connection, and this was the only way he knew how to ask for it. So I sat back down and kept quiet. Then he slowed down and began making a rocket. I talked to him about it. We continued like this for a few minutes before I slipped into the conversation: “So what happened today?” It was purely a question, no blame or anger in my tone. I believe that if I had criticized him, the gate that was slowly opening would have shut firmly closed. He told me that the teacher didn't let him do what he knew well due to safety but asked him to do what he disliked. He also admitted that he had enjoyed making her run around and saw it as a game. I explained that his teacher had not seen it as a game and was very upset. This again was stated simply as a fact. I suggested that next time he had a session, he talk about what he hoped to do at the start，which might be easier for everyone. He agreed and was quiet for a moment. Then he looked at me with tears in his eyes before quietly asking if he could go to find his teacher to apologize.",

      "article": "A traveller was staying in an Egyptian village. One day, she held up her camera to take pictures of the children. Suddenly the young ones began to shout at her. The traveller's face turned red and she apologized to the head for what she was doing, and told him she had forgotten that people in some places believed a person would lose his soul if his picture was taken. She explained to him the operation of a camera for a long time. Several times the head tried to say something, but he couldn't. When she believed that the head didn't fear any longer, the traveller then let him speak. With a smile, he said, \"The children were trying to tell you that you forgot to take off the lens cap!\"",

A few years later Hollywood was one of the most famous places of the world. From the 1910s to the 1950s Hollywood was the film center of the world. Every family knew the names of the film stars Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Bergman and hundreds more. The reason why people went to Hollywood to make films was the sun. At first people made films in New York on the east coast of the United States. But then they heard about Los Angeles where there are 350 days of sun every year. As they made all the films by sunlight, the west coast was a much better place to work. Also near Hollywood you can find mountains and sea and desert. They did not have to travel far to make any kind of film. When TV became popular in the 1960s, Hollywood started making films for television. Then in the 1970s they discovered people still went to cinema to see big expensive films. After twenty years they are still making films in Hollywood and people watch them all over the world.",

Bangkok In general，the more Westernized the place is，the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip. Some top end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not，waiters will appreciate you tacking onthe 10% yourself. However，if youˈre eating at a lower endrestaurant a tip is not necessary. If youˈre staying at one of Bangkokˈs many five star hotels，expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht，depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare up to the nearest five baht. Hong Kong Tipping is customary in this money mad metropolis. Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill，but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good，add another 10% to the bill，up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi，round upto the nearest dollar. Kuala Lumpur Tipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels，which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant，expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants，thereˈs no need to add a tip. At five star hotels，one or two ringgitwill content a porter. At lower end buildings donˈt feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok，many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit. Seoul Tipping is not part of Korean culture，although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If youˈre at a Korean barbecue joint，thereˈs no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If youˈre at a top end hotel，so expect to pay 500～1,000 won per bag. Taxi drivers donˈt accept a tip. Keep the change for yourself.",

Experts say that 5-10 percent of the average family's electric bill is from electronic appliances that are plugged in 24 hours a day. Televisions, computers, coffeemakers, toasters and even lamps can suck up power. If you are gone for any extended period, consider turning down the temperature on your water heater since there is no sense in keeping that water hot if you are not going to be around to use it. Choose a different way If you have a little extras time to spare, driving or taking a train to your destination might be an option. And there are always the long-haul options like Megabus. If you do have to take a plane, fly non-stop. If you want to have a lower carbon footprint, avoid private jets even if you can afford them. At the hotel Utilize every conservation program that the hotel offers. Reuse your towels and turn off your air conditioning or heat before you leave for the day. Bring your own soap, shampoo and moisturizer, or at least take whatever is left of the hotel-supplied notions home with you to finish using there. Skip the morning printed newspaper and read it on your Tablet PC, phone or computer. Drinking Carry a water bottle with you so that you don't have to buy plastic bottles. Travel to certain parts of the world and you will understand why. There's nothing more disturbing than seeing something made up of plastic bottles and bags. Halong Bay in Vietnam is a great example where this kind man-made pollution is clearly visible.",

      "article": "If you are interested in studying at an American university, you have to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language. The test is widely known as the TOEFL. It is the most widely used language exam for American universities. There are two major kinds of the TOEFL test. The first is the IBT, or Internet-based Test. It is offered in most of the world and accepted by nearly every university and scholarship program in the United States. The other kind of the test is called the Paper-based Test or PBT. The PBT is less costly to take and does not require use of the Internet. But how to get started with TOEFL? Here are some tips. 1,Plan ahead--- It takes a long time to improve your TOEFL score. Do not expect a big lift in your test results after two weeks. You will have to spend a lot of time and energy. 2,Master the basics first.---You should have to be good at basic English before you take the test. If you score below 500 on the PBT or 70 on the IBT, study for a few months and come back to the TOEFL later. 3,Get a study guide---It is easy to find study guides for the IBT. Pearson, Barron's, ETS, and Kaplan all produce quality materials. Take a practice test once or twice a month. The best study guides will have explanations in the answer key. 4,Use outside resources---Remember, you are learning a language, not a test. You can improve your TOEFL score by making English part of your daily life. Some simple ways are listening to English speakers, watching movies and reading newspapers Some others are reading English textbooks, sending and reading text messages in English, and writing online in English. The best way to do well on the TOEFL is to know English well. The real goal of the test is to measure how well a student can communicate in English-speaking classroom.

      "article": "B Goldfish have pretty boring lives，so maybe it's a good thing they can only concentrate for nine seconds! But according to new research，humans are becoming like goldfish. Our attention spanis getting shorter…and it's all because of technology. “We move quickly from one site to another on the web. ”says Doctor Ted Selker，a computer scientist from Massachusetts，“and we are losing the ability to concentrate. ”With millions of websites to choose from，the attention span of the average internet user is just seconds. There are other digital distractionstoo：email，instant messaging and quickie movies on websites. Some people are worried about the effect on young people “You need time to understand and think about what you read，”says Julia Wood，from London. “Young people search the net all the time and their brains become full of useless information but there is no time to make sense of it. I am trying to persuade my pupils to read more books，so that they concentrate on one subject for longer. ” Other teachers are trying more unusual methods to improve students' concentration. Anne Savan，from Wales，was so worried about her students that she started playing Mozart during her science lessons. She says that it had an amazing effect：“The music made them calmer，and their concentration was much better. ” But not everyone believes that there is a problem. Ray Cole，an educational psychologist says：“On the web，young people learn to make quick decisions about what is and isn't worth reading. They might look at five unhelpful websites very quickly，before stopping and reading a sixth useful website more carefully.

      ],
      "article": "“Fast fashion” means clothes that are inexpensive but look like the latest designs. One reason for the success of fast fashion is social media. A report by the investment research firm Bernstein found that Millennials—people born in the 1980s and 90s—wanted to wear a variety of clothes in the photos they posted on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. As a result, many businesses that offer trendy, low-cost clothes are growing. But the situation is changing now. Maxine Bédat, a woman who is in her early 30s, looks in her closet full of clothes, but she has nothing to wear. She says she hates always shopping for what is in style. Instead, she says, she wants to buy fewer clothes that she can wear over and over. Other people want the same thing, she says. So Ms. Bédat and a business partner, Soraya Darabi, started a “slow fashion” clothing company called Zady. “Slow fashion” means clothes that last a long time. They are often classic colors and shapes, and are made from natural materials that are biodegradable over time. The terms “fast fashion” and “slow fashion” are related to “fast food” and “slow food”: fast food is still popular in the U. S. , but many restaurants increasingly offer higher-quality, more expensive and relaxed meals. Like slow food, slow fashion also aims to use sources that are good for the environment and workers. Maxine Bédat says people in her generation want to know where their clothes come from and who is making them. To answer Millennials' demand for information about the products they buy, Ms. Bédat's company, Zady, includes details about the history of the brands. It also describes the process in which the clothes are made. Ms. Bédat says Zady aims to tell shoppers where their clothes come from, where they go, and how they impact the world. The international business “H&M” is answering Millennials' demands in another way. It has created a recycling program for clothes. Shoppers who bring clothes they no longer want to H&M stores can receive a discount on new things they buy. An H&M spokesperson says, “We have a clear vision to avoid and minimize waste that goes into landfills.”",

      "article": "C In the United States, it is not usual to telephone someone early in the morning. If you telephone early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. So it is with the telephone calls made after 11:00 pm. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he may think that it's a matter of life and death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the USA guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party reaches them only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time is not the same in different cultures that treat time differently; being on time is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not on time, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the USA no one would think of keeping a business friend for an hour; it would be too impolite. A person who is 5 minutes late is expected to make a short apology. It he is less than 5 minutes late, he will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.",

There is no single best shoe for every runner. You should find the shoe that offers the best fit and support for your feet. More importantly, you should have a new pair of shoes every 500 to 800 kilometers. ⊙Take good notes. Take time after each run to write down notes about what you did and how you felt.

      ],
      "article": "Harry Steenbock is professor of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin—Madison，and he is best remembered for his discovery of a way to increase the vitamin D content of foods in the early 1920s. This important discovery virtually got rid of rickets，a disabling bone disease. Steenbock's work was pioneering in another way，too：his attempt to patent and market his technology led to the establishment of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation，now a major partner of the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery. While working in his UW—Madison lab in late 1923,Steenbock discovered that he could increase the vitamin D content of foods by irradiatingthem with ultraviolet light. Steenbock was eager to share his breakthrough discovery with the world. But，he knew he needed to carefully manage his discovery so it could reach its full potential and benefit the greater good. Steenbock submitted a patent application with $ 300 of his own money to protect his discovery. The Quaker Oats Company offered Steenbock a deal valued at nearly $ 1 million(almost $ 10 million in today's money)for exclusive rights to his invention. Despite this hugeamount of money，Steenbock turned down the Quaker deal. He felt that the profits from his discovery should be returned to the university to make future scientific research possible—and he had a vision for how to protect his breakthrough discovery and pass its benefits on to the public. Steenbock imagined a nonprofit foundation that would protect discoveries made by UW—Madison researchers through patent management and licensing，invest in research—based discoveries，and return profits to the university to finance further scientific inquiry. Nine generous alumni donated $100 each to aid the efforts and on November14，1925，the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation(WARF) became one of the nation's first university—based technology transfer offices. The new patent management agency carried out its first license agreement in February 1927 with the Quaker Oats Company. Quaker went on to use Steenbock's irradiation techniques to increase the amount of vitamin D in breakfast grains.",

And so far, we have achieved many successes. But there are still numerous tasks in front of us and we should not stop trying to progress. The international space station (ISS) is an important step we should take in space exploration. It is not only helpful but also necessary. It provides a proper space environment for many experiments that we have wanted to do for a long time. It is also a base for the observations of the earth and the universe. It could also be an important base for later travel to the moon and Mars. In a word, if we want to explore space more, the first thing we should do is to set up a space station. As the space station costs a lot of money, it is hard for one country alone to establish one. The USA seems to be the only country that has the ability to build a space station alone，and it has tried to do so, but not very successful. So it aggregated many other countries to work on it together. Though it is still extremely expensive, it is much cheaper than doing it alone. It is really a job that needs everyone's effort and will benefit everyone. Led by the U.S. and Russia, the ISS is a joint project between six space agencies involving 16 countries. Called the greatest achievement in human cooperation, the ISS has come to the end of a ten-year's hard work in construction. China has applied for taking part in the project many times. Unfortunately all the applications were rejected, which drove China onto the path of independent development. As the Long March Ⅱ-F/T1 carrier rocket blasted off (leave the ground) and successfully carried the Tiangong-1 into space on September 29, 2011, China takes a big step toward its Space Station Era. Some West media suggested that the successful launch of Tiangong-1 would disturb the balance of global space power, raising concerns about “China threat”. China's space project is not designed for military purpose but for developing space technology to explore space resources and make use of them for mankind's well-being.",

In 1988，at the age of 50，she became the first woman to travel alone to the North Pole.She pulled her own sled piled with 160 pounds of supplies，and during her trip no one brought her fresh supplies.Accompanied only by her dog Charlie，she survived cold weather and meetings with polar bears.In fact，Charlie saved her life when one of them attacked her.Near the end of her trip，a forceful wind blew away the majority of her supplies.The last week of the trip，she survived on a handful of nuts and a little water each day. Helen goes to challenging places not only for adventure，but also for education.Before her Arctic journey，she started a website called Adventure Classroom.On the site，she shares her adventures in order to motivate students.She explains，“although kids often see the world in a negative way，without hope for their future，we work to inspire them to set goals，plan for success and never give up...” Helen grew up in New Zealand.Her parents were athletes and mountain climbers.Following her parents' example，she climbed her first mountain at 9.Later，she climbed the highest mountains in North and South America，the former USSR and New Zealand. In 1996，she took on another challenge—the Sahara Desert.She and her husband，Bill，walked 2,400 miles across it！In 2001，she and Bill traveled on foot from west to east through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia.They hope to travel in mainland China into Sichuan and Tibet to study pandas this year. Helen plans to continue taking trips.She'll use her explorations，writing，photography and environmental work to create programs for her Adventure Classroom website.She wants to inspire her students never to stop facing challenges！",

Perhaps he sent you to a hospital, but all the advanced equipment there shows that there is nothing wrong with you. Then, consider this: you might be in a state of subhealth . Subhealth, also called the third state or gray state, is explained as a borderline state between health and disease. According to the investigation by the National Health Organization, over 45 percent of subhealthy people are middle-aged or elderly. The percentage is even higher among people who work in management posit ions as well as students around exam-week. Symptoms include a lack of energy, depression , slow reactions, insomnia , and poor memory. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating and aching in the waist and legs. The key to preventing and recovering from subhealth, according to some medical experts, is to form good living habits, alternate work and rest, exercise regularly, and take part in open air activities. As for meals, people are advised to eat less salt and sugar. They should also eat more fresh vegetables, fruits, fish because they are rich in nutritional elements---vitamins and trace elements--- that are important to the body. Nutrition experts point out that it is not good to eat too much at one meal because it may cause unhealthy changes in the digestive tract . They also say that a balanced diet is very helpful in avoiding subhealth.",

It was essentially a large garbage dump on wheels. I must admit that the apple doesn't fall from the tree because until I got my present car, all of my many automobiles had been messy too. The worst thing about her car was that it took on water every time it rained. No one could ever find the source of the leak, which created a pool on the floor of the front passenger side. It also created tides: When I drove uphill, the water rushed to the back. When I drove downhill, the water rushed to the front. Four years ago, when I turned 50, I got a new car. I turned over a new leaf and, for the first time since I got my driver's license, cleaned up my act. I gave my old car, which contained old leaves, to my wife, who in turn gave her car to Lauren. It's the one Lauren was driving—and filling with so much stuff that there was barely enough room in the back seat for her little dog, Maggie—until she got her new car. A few weeks ago, Lauren decided to go car shopping. She went to a Volkswagen dealership because she had her eye on a Jetta. She had her other eye on my wallet. Anyway, she saw a 2005 model, which was shown to her by an automotive associate named Anthony. He spent a lot of time with Lauren each of the three or four times she visited the dealership, let me test-drive the car when I went to see it, and didn't put any pressure on any of us. In short, Anthony gave used car salesmen a good name. But he was no match for Lauren when it came to negotiating the price, which he lowered to what she said she could afford and not a penny more. So now, at 25, which is half the age I was when I cleaned up my act, Lauren has done the same. Her car has been clean for almost three months. Even the dog is impressed. The downside is that my wife's car is messy. And she wants a new one, too.",

Two 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, rowed out a boat to search for a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for it and the boat was out of control. Tim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves. “Everything went quiet in my head,” Tim recalls . “I was trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.” Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. “At one point, I considered turning back,” he says. “I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.” After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to yell to the boys, “Take down the umbrella!” Christian made much effort to take down the umbrella. Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat. He took over rowing, but the waves were almost too strong for him. “Let's aim for the pier ,” Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. “Can you guys swim?” he cried. “A little bit,” the boys said. Once they were in the water, Tim decided it would he safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys' faces. “Are we almost there?” they asked again and again. “Yes,” Tim told them each time. After 30minutes, they reached the pier.",

In Revere, Massachusetts, a hundred policemen searched for a lost boy who left his home in his sleep and woke up five hours later on a strange sofa in a strange living room, with no idea how he had got there. At the University of Lowa, a student was reported to have the habit of getting up in the middle of the night and walking three-quarters of a mile to the Lowa River. He would take a swim and then go back to his room to bed. An American expert on sleep claims that he has never seen a sleepwalker. He is said to know more about sleep than any other living man, and during the last thirty-five years he has lost a lot of sleep watching people sleep. He says, “Of course, I know that there are sleepwalkers because I have read about them in the newspapers. But none of my sleepers ever walked, and if I were to advertise for sleepwalkers for an experiment, I doubt whether I would get many takers.” Sleepwalking, however, is a scientific reality. It is one of those strange things that sometimes look quite fantastic. Doctors say that sleepwalking is much more common than is generally supposed. Many sleepwalkers do not try to find help and their sleepwalking is never recorded.",

Sometimes I think he loves you more than he loves me. He's addicted to you, to the way you promise to rid him of his problems only to cause more of them. You just sat back and laughed as his car went spinning through the street, crashing into two other cars. He wasn't the only one hurt by you that night. Do you remember the night of my first high school party? You were there. My friends were intrigued by you. They treated you as if they were never going to see you again, drinking all of you that they could. I spent two hours that night helping my friends who had fallen completely. \"I'm so embarrassed,\" they said as I held their hair back so that they could vomit. \"I'm sorry,\" they said when I called taxies for them, walking them out and paying the driver in advance. \"This won't happen again,\" they said as they were sent to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped. Two 15-year-old girls slept in hospital beds that night thanks to you. Do you remember the night when you took advantage of my 17-year-old neighbor who had to drive to pick up his sister from her dance lessons? Do you know how we all felt when he hit another car and killed the two people in the other car? He died the next morning too. His sister walked home from her dance lesson, and passed police cars and a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk just two blocks away from the dance studio. She didn't realize her brother was in the midst of it all. She never saw him again. And it's all your fault. I wish you'd walk out of my life forever. I don't want anything to do with you. Look at all the pain you've caused. Sure, you've made people happy too from time to time. But the damage you've caused in the lives of millions is inexcusable. Stop luring in the people I love. Stop hurting me, please. Sincerely, Anonymous",

Wherever you go, you will see cars. There are so many cars that there are traffic jams here and there. Now, more and more Americans would not consider it a healthy way of life. In fact, many Americans are strongly against the advancement of the wheel. We should encourage people to use fewer cars to save our environment and the energy. Everyone wants to reduce pollution. But the pollution problem is very serious. People drive cars and the waste gas from them causes air pollution. On the other hand, the need for energy increases every day, and some sources of energy are running out. Oil will last for no more than 40 years, while coal could last another 300 years. The way we're heading is towards a world where people are going to go cold and hungry. Now in China many rich men live away from downtown. On holidays they go to some big cities and places of interest. Most of them use their own cars. But China is a country with a population of over 1.3 billion.

      "article": "D EDGEWOOD—Every morning at Dixie Heights High School，customers pour into a special experiment：the district's first coffee shop run mostly by students with special learning needs. Well before classes start，students and teachers order Lattes，Cappuccinos and Hot Chocolates. Then，during the first period，teachers call in orders on their room phones，and students make deliveries. By closing time at 9.20 a. m. ，the shop usually sells 90 drinks. “Whoever made the chi tea，Ms.Schatzman says it was good，”Christy McKinley，a second year student，announced recently，after hanging up with the teacher. The shop is called the Dixie PIT，which stands for Power in Transition. Although some of the students are not disabled，many are，and the PIT helps them prepare for life after high school. They learn not only how to run a coffee shop but also how to deal with their affairs. They keep a timecard and receive paychecks，which they keep in check registers. Special－education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia. Not that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product－related. Should schools be selling coffee？What about sugar content？ Kenton County food Service Director Ginger Gray helped. She made sure all the drinks，which use non－fat milk，fell within nutrition guidelines. The whole school has joined in to help. Teachers agreed to give up their lounge in the mornings. Art students painted the name of the shop on the wall. Business students designed the paychecks. The basketball team helped pay for cups.",

He sent his camera crew out one evening to film the sunset for him. The next morning he said to the men, “Have you provided me with that sunset?” “No, sir,” the men answered. The director was angry. “Why not?”, he asked. 　 “Well, sir,” one of the men answered,” we're on the east coast here, and the sun sets in the west. We can get you a sunrise over the sea, if necessary, but not a sunset.” “But I want a sunset!\" the director shouted. ”Go to the airport, take the next flight to the west coast, and get one.” 　　But then a young secretary had an idea. “Why don't you photograph a sunrise,” she suggested,” and then play it backwards? Then it'll look like a sunset.” 　　“That's a very good idea!” the director said. Then he turned to the camera crew and said, “Tomorrow morning I want you to get me a beautiful sunrise over the sea.” The camera crew went out early the next morning and filmed a bright sunrise over the beach in the middle of a beautiful bay. Then at nine o'clock they took it to the director. “Here it is, sir,” they said, and gave it to him. He was very pleased. 　　They all went into the studio. “All right,” the director explained, “now our hero and heroine are going to say goodbye. Run the film backwards so that we can see the sunset behind them.” The sunset began, but after a quarter of a minute, the director suddenly put his face in his hands and shouted to the camera crew to stop. 　　The birds in the film were flying backwards, and the waves on the sea were going away from the beach.",

Sixteen years ago I learned a lesson. I got in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane when all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver used his brakes , the tires made a loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just 3cm from the back of the other car. I couldn't believe it. But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head around and he started shouting at us. I couldn't believe it! My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. So, I said, “Why did you just do that? This guy could have killed us!” And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call, “The Law of the Garbage Truck”. He said, “Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger and disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump it. And if you let them, they'll dump it on you. So I started thinking how often I let Garbage Trucks run right over me and how often I take their garbage and spread it to other people. I began to see Garbage Trucks. I see the load people are carrying. I see them coming to dump it. And like my taxi driver, I don't take it personally. I just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on.",

      "article": "Sydneyis Australia's most exciting city. The history of Australia began here. In 1788, Captain Arthur Philips arrived in Sydney with 11 ships and 1,024 passengers from Britain (including 770 prisoners). Today there are 2.5 million people in Sydney. It is the biggest city in Australia, and one of the most beautiful cities in the world. There are over 20 fine beaches close to Sydney. Its warm summer climate and cool winter have made it a favorite city for immigrants from overseas. There are three things that made Sydney famous－its beautiful harbor , the Sydney Harbor Bridge, and the Sydney Opera House. But there are many more interesting things in Sydney: beautiful shops and restaurants, for example, rows of interesting old houses built in the 19th century, and everywhere, the sea. Summer or winter, day or night, Sydney is an outdoor city. Some Americans think it is very British. Some British visitors think it is like America. There is some truth in both these opinions, because Sydney takes from both the Old World—Europe, and the New World— America, and makes it into something that is neither British nor American but truly Australian.",

The Nobel committee praised their work on what it calls a \"novel therapy.\" The treatment fights infections caused by roundworm parasites.The prize for medicine is also going to Chinese researcher Tu Youyou. She discovered artemisinin. Artemisinin is a drug that has sharply lowered the number of people who die from malaria. The committee said the discoveries have given the world powerful news ways to fight two powerful diseases. It said those diseases affect hundreds of millions of people every year. The committee added that, \"The consequences in terms of improved human health and reduced suffering are immeasurable.\" Ms. Tu is the chief professor at the China Academy of Traditional Medicine. She is also the first Chinese citizen to be awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine. Mr. Campbell currently works as a research fellowemeritus at Drew University in New Jersey. Mr. Omura has two doctorate degrees -- one in pharmaceutical sciences, the other in chemistry. He is professor emeritus at Kitasato University in Japan. Doctors are now using avermectin to treat river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. Mr. Omura told the Associated Press that the drug resulted from a substancetaken from a microbefound on a golf course near Tokyo. The researcher said he always carries a plastic bag so he can collect soil samples. When asked if he likes to play golf, he smiled and said, ˈyes.ˈ A member of the Nobel committee, also spoke with the AP. This member said that the award for Tu Youyou is the result of a major change in the way China performs scientific research. He says China has invested a lot of money in such research.

People who are near-sighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes, everything else seems blurry. Many people who do a lot of work, such as writing, reading and sewing become near-sighted. Then people who are far-sighted suffer from just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty in reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses, too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. They have what is called astigmatism . This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. Having two good eyes is important for judging distances. Each eye sees things from a slightly different angle . To prove this to yourself, look at an object out of one eye; then look at the same object out of your other eye. You will find the object's relation to the background and other things around it has changed. The difference between these two different eye views helps us to judge how far away an object is. People who have only one eye cannot judge distance as people with two eyes.",

      "article": "Monarch butterflies from eastern Canada make the most amazing journey in the insect world. Each year， this butterfly travels about 3000 miles to its winter home in central Mexico. How can it fly so far？ And why does it make this long and dangerous trip？ Scientists still don't have an answer. For many years， people in Mexico wondered where the orange—and—black butterflies came from every winter. Then， in 1937， a scientist started to follow and study the butterflies. For the next 20 years， he discovered that one butterfly started its journey in Canada. Four months later， it arrived in Mexico. The length of the butterflies' trip is only one part of the mystery. Another amazing thing is that the butterflies always return to the same area in central Mexico. How do the butterflies find their way back to the same place？ This is an interesting question because only every fourth generation makes the trip south. In other words， the butterfly that travels to Mexico this year is the great great grandchild of the butterfly that traveled there last year. Each year， four generations of a Monarch butterfly family are born. Each generations of the family has a very different life. The first generation is born in the south in late April. It slowly moves north， reproduces ， and then die. Each of these generations of butterflies lives for generations are born， reproduces， and die. Each of these generations of butterflies lives for only two or five weeks. In the autumn， the fourth generation of butterflies is born. This generation has a much longer life. It lives for about eight months. This generation of butterflies makes the amazing journey back to the winter there， and in the spring they reproduce and then die. Their offspring will be the first generation of the next circle of life. Today， people are still studying the Monarch butterfly. But they are not clear about everything.",

      "article": "Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cellsin important organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if there are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiatedand feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth.",

Paragraph 2 People in different countries and different places of the world eat different kinds of things. Foods are cooked and eaten in many different kinds of ways. People in different countries eat at different times of the day. In some places people eat once or twice a day; n other countries people eat three or four times a day.

It doesn't matter if a person eats dinner at 4 o'clock in the afternoon or at eleven o'clock at night. The important thing is what you eat every day.

They worried about being hurt in a car accident, killed in a plane crash, getting sick, and so on. All they could think about was being ill or hurt. One day they went on a train journey together. \"We'll need some food,\" Pearl said. \"We'll buy some bananas,\" June said. \"They are good to eat and always clean.\" And so they bought two bananas to eat on the train. It was not long before they were hungry. Pearl took out the bananas and gave one to June. Then she peeled the skin of her banana and took a large bite of it. At that moment the train went into a tunnel. Everything went black. \"Don't eat your banana,\" Pearl shouted at June. \"Mine has made me go blind!\"",

      "article": "Less than 60 percent of students now entering four-year American colleges are likely to graduate. The completion rate is lower than almost any other wealthy country，and worst for poor and minority students. On Tuesday President Obama gave a nationally broadcast speech to students about the importance of staying in school. He spoke on the first day of classes at a high school in Virginia. He talked about personal responsibility，and took himself as an example of someone who overcame difficulties. “My father left my family when I was two years old，and I was raised by a single mother who had to work and struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us things the other kids had. There were times when I missed having a father in my life. There were times when I was lonely and felt like I didn't fit in，” said President Obama. But he told students that problems in their own lives should not stop them from learning.“There's no excuse for talking back to your teacher，or cutting class or dropping out of school. There's no excuse for not trying.” This was not the first presidential speech to students. Ronald Reagan spoke from the White House in 1988.And George H.W. Bush spoke from a school in Washington in 1991. But many conservatives criticized plans for the speech. Some called it “socialized education” or federal interferencein local schools. Others feared it would be too political. Some schools decided not to show the speech. But the White House released the text on Monday，and that calmed a lot of critics. On Sunday，on the CBS program “Face the Nation”，Education Secretary Arne Duncan said 30 percent of students do not graduate from high school. He called the dropout rate “staggering”.It represents more than a million students every year who entered the ninth grade but did not complete the 12th grade.",

I had been criticizing her dirty window, but all the time I was watching hers through my own dirty window. 　　That was quite an important lesson for me. How often had I looked at and criticized others through the dirty window of my heart, through my own shortcomings? 　　Since then, whenever I wanted to judge someone, I asked myself first, \"Am I looking at him through my own dirty window?\" 　　Then I try to clean the window of my own world so that I may see the world about me more clearly.",

The hospital let me have a few days on holiday, so I decided to go into the jungle and I asked a Nepalese guide, Kamal Rai, to go with me. We started our trip at six in the morning with two elephants carrying our equipment. It was hot, but Kamal made me wear shoes and trousers to protect me from snakes. In the jungle there was a lot of wildlife, but we were trying to find big cats, especially tigers. We climbed onto the elephants backs to see better, but it is unusual to find tigers in the afternoon because they sleep in the daytime. Then, in the distance, we saw a tiger, and Kamal told me to be very quiet. We moved nearer and found a dead deer. This was the tiger's lunch! I started to feel very frightened. We heard the tiger a second before we saw it. It jumped out suddenly, five hundred kilos plus and four meters long. It grabbed Kamal's leg between its teeth, but I succeeded in pulling Kamal away. One of our elephants ran at the tiger and made it go back into the grass, so we quickly escaped to let the tiger eat its lunch. That night it was impossible to sleep.",

      "article": "Dear Disney, Last weekend, the four members of my family spent an enjoyable holiday at the Magic Kingdom―Disneyland. And one event made our visit seem truly magical. We got to the front of the line at Space Mountain, only to find out that our little daughter Gloria couldn't take her ice－cream on the ride. We were so excited that we all forgot ice－cream was not allowed on the ride. Gloria broke into tears and we all had no idea what to do. Then Murphy, one of the staff members, came over. She bent down and told Gloria that she would hold the ice－cream for her and give it to her when she finished the ride. Gloria said, “Promise?” Then she gave Murphy her ice－cream, and she completely enjoyed the ride. Sure enough, as we walked out the exit, there was Gloria's new friend with“her”ice－cream. Now you and I both know what happened, because we know that an ice－cream won't last twenty minutes on a summer afternoon in Florida. Murphy knew what time we would get off the ride；she went to the nearest shop and bought a brand－new ice－cream thirty seconds before we walked out the exit. Gloria said, “Thank you,” but I'm sure she thought it was the same ice－cream. We know that someone tried hard to make our visit special. Thanks so much for going above and beyond! Yours, Carmen Rivera",

This is in keeping with traditions in many countries ---- in both the West and the East. Another way of naming places is naming them after other places. Perhaps they were named to promote friendships between the two places or it could be that the people who used to live there were originally from the places that the roads were named after. The mystery is clearer when we see some of the roads named in former British bases. If you step into Selector Airbase you will see Piccadilly Circus ---- obviously named by some homesick Royal Air Force personnel. Sine places were named after the activities that used to go on at those places. Bras Basah Road is an interesting example, “Base Basah” means “wet rice” in Malay. Now why would anyone want to name a road “Wet Rice Road”? The reason is simple. During the pioneering days, wet rice was laid out to dry along this road. A few roads in Singapore are named by their shapes. There is “Circular Road” for one. Other roads may have part of their names to describe their shapes, like “Paya Lebar Crescent”. This road is called a crescent because it begins on the main road, makes a crescent and comes back to join the main road again.",

Fifty years later, there were 120 “Bow Street Runners”, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So in 1829, the first Metropolitan(or London)Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men.

Mrs. Brown began to think it over and then she said she wished her husband would be able to buy a nice umbrella for her, and so did their three daughters. As he was afraid he would forget it, he drew an umbrella on his hand. To his regret, he lost it at the station. On the train Mr. Brown sat opposite to an old woman. The woman's umbrella was so nice that he carefully looked at it and said to himself not to forget to buy a few umbrellas like it. When the train arrived at the station in London, he said good-bye to the old woman, took his bag and her umbrella and was going to get off. “Wait a minute, sir,” shouted the old woman. “That's my umbrella!” Now Mr. Brown noticed that he had taken her umbrella. His face turned red at once and said in a hurry,“ Oh, I'm very sorry, Madam! I didn't mean it!” Seven days later Mr. Brown left the capital. To his surprise, he met the old woman and sat opposite to her again. Looking at the four umbrellas, the old woman was satisfied with herself. “It seems that I had a better result than the other four women.” She thought.",

      "article": "D Their cheery song brightens many a winter's day.But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much.Robins are singing all night―as well as during the day,British-based researchers say. David Dominoni,of Glasgow University,said that light from street lamps,takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clocks,leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni,who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns,said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk.His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab,it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day.And the more birds are exposed to light,the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference,“There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing.Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy.So by increasing their song output,there might be some costs of energy.” And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light.Blackbirds and seagulls are also being more nocturnal.Dr Dominoni said,“In Glasgow where I live,gulls are a serious problem.I have people coming to me saying‘You are the bird expert.Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breedingseason,between April and June,they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.” Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution,other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However,some birds thrivein noisy environments.A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery.It is thought that they are capitalising on their predatorsfleeing to quieter areas.",

If you look closely, you may see that his tail is wagging farther to his right. If he were afraid, his tail would wag farther to the left instead. \"Animals cannot tell us about their emotions, but dogs can wag their tails, \"says Dr. Giorgio Vallortigara,a scientist who studied dogs' tail wagging. Scientists have studied the brains of animals and people for years. They know the brain has two halves. The two sides do different jobs. In people, the left side handles our feelings about things we like. It sparks our love for a parent and our feeling of safety under a warm blanket. The right side handles our feelings about things we don't like. It triggers fear, wor-ry, and sadness. Some animals' brains also divide these jobs. Many birds use the right eye to look for food and the left eye to watch for cats. That's because the left side of the brain is in charge of feeding and the right side handles danger. How about dogs? Do their feelings af-fect their tails wagging? Dr. Vallortigara and two other scientists designed a special box for the dogs, and put in one dog at a time. The dogs could see out only through a panel in one of the walls. The re-searchers showed four things to each dog: its owner; a stranger; a calm cat; a big dog it had never seen before. The big dog was trained to act as if it wanted to be \"the boss.\" When the dogs saw their owners, they all wagged their tails strongly. The tails swung far to the right most of the time. Their tails also swung to the right when they saw another person or a calm cat. When the dogs in the box saw the mean-looking dog, their tails wagged farther to the left. \"The muscles in the right side of the tail show us his positive emotions,\" says Dr. Vallortiga-ra. \"The muscles in the left side express negative feelings.\" He thinks this knowledge will help vets treat their patients and they can tell what makes a dog happy and what doesn't.",

      "article": "Without proper planning, tourism can cause problems. For example, too many tourists can crowd public places that are also enjoyed by the inhabitants of a country. If tourists create too much traffic, the inhabitants become annoyed and unhappy. They begin to dislike tourists and to treat them impolitely. They forget how much tourism can help the country's economy. It is important to think about the people of a destination country and how tourism affects them. Tourism should help a country keep the customs and beauty that attract tourists. Tourism should also improve the wealth and happiness of local inhabitants. Too much tourism can be a problem. If tourism grows too quickly, people must leave other jobs to work in the tourism industry. This means that other parts of the country's economy can suffer. On the other hand, if there is not enough tourism，people can lose jobs. Businesses can also lose money. It costs a great deal of money to build large hotels, airports，air terminals, first－class roads, and other support facilitiesneeded by tourist attractions. For example, a major international class tourism hotel can cost as much as 50 thousand dollars per room to build. If this room is not used most of the time, the owners of the hotel lose money. Building a hotel is just a beginning. There must be many support facilities as well，including roads to get to the hotel, electricity, workers to carry away waste and water. All of these support facilities cost money. If they are not used because there are not enough tourists, jobs and money are lost.",

      "article": "Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: “ THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.”",

      "article": "MY younger daughter, Lauren, has a new car and she has managed to keep it spotlessly clean since she bought it in July. Lauren's old car was messy. It was essentially a large garbage dump on wheels. I must admit that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because until I got my present car, all of my many automobiles had been messy too. The worst thing about her car was that it took on water every time it rained. No one could ever find the source of the leak, which created a pool on the floor of the front passenger side. It also created tides: When I drove uphill, the water rushed to the back. When I drove downhill, the water rushed to the front. Four years ago, when I turned 50, I got a new car. I turned over a new leaf and, for the first time since I got my driver's license, cleaned up my act. I gave my old car, which contained old leaves, to my wife, who in turn gave her car to Lauren. It's the one Lauren was driving – and filling with so much stuff that there was barely enough room in the back seat for her little dog, Maggie – until she got her new car. A few weeks ago, Lauren decided to go car shopping. She went to a Volkswagen dealership because she had her eye on a Jetta. She had her other eye on my wallet. Anyhow, she saw a 2005 model, which was shown to her by an automotive associate named Anthony. He spent a lot of time with Lauren each of the three or four times she visited the dealership, let me test-drive the car when I went to see it, and didn't put any pressure on any of us. In short, Anthony gave used car salesmen a good name. But he was no match for Lauren when it came to negotiating the price, which he lowered to what she said she could afford and not a penny more. So now, at 25, which is half the age I was when I cleaned up my act, Lauren has done the same. Her car has been clean for almost three months. Even the dog is impressed. The downside is that my wife's car is messy. And she wants a new one, too.",

      "article": "Conventional wisdom is a major barrier to innovation that threatens the survival of companies everywhere. It's based on the assumption that old ideas will always work, so they shouldn't be challenged. While this may be a valid assumption in situations that don't change, it's unlikely to hold true in a changing situation. In today's rapid changing global environment, old methods often don't work, and stubbornly using them can lead to major problems. Most people seem to agree with conventional wisdom because it gives one a false sense of security. If everyone else believes it, then it must be true. Individuals who use conventional wisdom are certain that they are right, and being right is good. They want to continue using old ideas rather than take risks with changes that might not work. In 1977, Ken Olsen, co-founder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), stated: “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.” Despite being a dominant leader in the computer industry, DEC no longer exists. People seem to forget that since innovation is a change, there can be no innovation without change. Unfortunately, conventional wisdom prevents leaders, followers and companies from changing and therefore innovating. If companies don't innovate, but their competitors do, the future is likely to be problematic. Breaking from conventional wisdom has led to many of the most innovative companies and products in history across many industries, so it has a powerful effect on business success. Ted Turner (founder of CNN) knew little, if anything, about the news business, but he knew it was inconvenient to watch news only at the dinner hour, as was common before CNN. Turner's solution was to create a cable channel dedicated to news 24 hours a day. The news establishment reflected conventional wisdom at the time, and predicted his idea would fail because no one wanted to watch the news all day. However, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that viewers don't have to watch the news all day for the CNN to work. Viewers just have to watch when they want to get information. Due to conventional thinking, the critics failed to recognize the opportunity that was clear to Ted. They assumed that only what was familiar to them could work in the future. Conventional wisdom prevents creativity, flexibility and risk-taking, so unconventional leaders enthusiastically break from it. To survive, thrive and maintain competitive advantage, companies must be flexible when reacting to change.",

      "article": "In Melbourne, Australia, not long ago specialists gave advice on a patient's problem. There's nothing unusual in that except that the patient was in the far west of New South Wales at the time. That's hundreds of miles from Melbourne. The heart disease experts were able to make their diagnosis after listening to the patient's heartbeat over the telephone. They were testing a new device that can change readings of a patient's heartbeat into tone signals that can be sent by telephone. The device was designed in Australia. It is meant for use in areas far from large cities. Doctors in remote areas can take the heartbeat readings right in the patient's home. Then they can play them over a telephone line to specialists in larger centers. The doctor in the remote area is thus able to get an expert's opinion on the heart condition of his patient. Experiments with the device show that the whole process takes only a few minutes",

      "article": "I'm sitting here in this coffee shop. You know the one there by Allen street. The town is filled with thousands of middle class college kids living off their parent's money. The coffee shop is where the ones come to play the part of sophisticated bohemians . The pretensions glow from their line-less faces as they sip cappuccinos and chew strawberry cookies. The boys to my right are discussing Nabokov with a serious air, a copy of Sartre's Cuba lies on the table. The young woman on my left is declaring that she can never allow her creativity to be killed by entering the work force. The man with her scratches his goatee in agreement, occasionally suggesting they go back to his place to hear his new Washington Squares CD. Matt has just designed a new international symbol for peace. He moves from table to table trying to sell hand painted T-shirts that bear the design. Tomorrow he's leaving for the 25th anniversary Woodstock concert where he hopes to strike it rich with his creation. Gopha the skinny Indian boy feels like singing me a verse of ‘It Ain't Me Babe' when I ask him if he's a friend of Monica's. Jason is trying to talk Gopha into a dollar bet on a game of chess. Between times Jason will chew your ear off with his plans to conquer the music industry while studying entertainment law, but when it comes to his never ending dollar chess matches he's quiet as a church mouse. I sit among them. To all surface appearances one and the same. If they could only see I would rather reach into their flesh and tear out their shallow little hearts than listen to another second of their prattle . With no job, no gigs, and my girlfriend's so far gone she might as well be on another planet, I've been leading the writer's quiet cafe life, spending my free time outdoors drinking iced teas and cheap wines. I chat warmly with whoever decides to squander away their hours in my surrounding area. But behind my eyes is an unspoken challenge to any and every one of these social elites to just once say one thing that would inspire me. Just one little idea which is new and meaningful. Unfortunately original thoughts are zero here. In my secret mind I wish to run like a madman banging gongs and speaking in tongues. Or maybe jump on a table and sing the Star Spangled Banner in the forgotten language of the Hottentots. I know these thoughts only reveal me as a fool because the spark I search for cannot be found in acts of shocking performance art. Where it truly comes from is one of the mysteries which will always hang around me.",

One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all feelings constructed boats and left, except for Love. Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. 　 Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?” Richness answered, “No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.” Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, please help me!” “I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered. 　 Sadness was close by, so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.” “Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!” 　 Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. 　 Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who helped me?” “It was Time,” Knowledge answered. “Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?” Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”",

Room3 As well as shoes and boots, the museum also exhibits shoe-shaped objects. The variety is unbelievable. For example, there is a metal lamp that resembles a pair of shoes ,and Greek wine bottles that look like legs!

Training may be for the purpose of companionship, detection, protection, entertainment or all of the above. An animal trainermay use various forms of reinforcement or punishment to condition an animalˈs responses. Some animal trainers may have a knowledge of the principles of behavior analysis and operant conditioning , but there are many ways to train animals and as a general rule no legal requirements or certifications are required. Training chickens has become a way for trainers of other animals (primarily dogs) to perfect their training technique. Bob Bailey, former director of Animal Behavior Enterprises and the IQ Zoo, teaches in chicken training courses where trainers teach chickens to tell different shapes, to navigate an obstacle course and to chain behaviors together. Chicken training is done using operant conditioning, using a clicker and chicken feed for reinforcement. Fish can also be trained. For example, a goldfish may swim toward its owner and follow him as he walks through the room, but will not follow anyone else. The fish may swim up and down, signaling the owner to turn on its aquarium light when it is off, and it will skim the surface until its owner feeds it. Pet goldfish have also been taught to perform more complicated tasks, such as doing the limbo (a kind of dance) and pushing a miniature soccer ball into a net.",

He hated to read, so he watched the traffic. Suddenly he saw a bag fall off a truck and it landed by the other side of the street. “It must be full of expensive things,” Henry said to himself. “I have to get it, or others will take it away. ” He went out of the shop and ran across the street. A driver saw him and began to whistle, but he didn't hear it and went on running. The man drove aside, hit a big tree and was hurt in the accident. Two weeks later Henry was taken to court. A judge asked if he heard the whistle when he was running across the street. He said that something was wrong with his ears and he could hear nothing. “But you've heard me this time.” said the judge. “Oh, I'm sorry. Now I can hear with one ear.” “Cover the ear with your hand and listen to me with your deafone. Well, can you hear me? ” “No, I can't. sir. ”",

      "article": "Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. We go fishing, sit in the garden, have a picnic, live in the suburbs or go to the seaside. The most popular leisure activity in Britain is going for a walk. When joggers jog, they don't run the streets. Every one of them tend to go to the park or the river. But despite this, our children are growing up nature deprived . I spent my boyhood climbing trees. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and strange new ideas about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found. The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%. ADHD is one of the great problems of modern childhood. One study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places. The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing concern for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality. Even problems with crime and aggressive behavior are reduced when there is contact with the natural world. We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health and our happiness.",

      "article": "When it comes to building a comfortable home, Jim Higgins has his own ideas. The retired transport manager has one of the most special houses in Britain, because it is built around a real railway carriage. The small house in Ashton, Cornwall, is a fully functioning home, but, bizarrely, has a fully restored 130-year-old Great Western Railway car within its walls. Mr. Higgins, 64, took over the property from his father-in-law, Charles Allen. Mr. Higgins said:”The railway carriage was lived in by a local woman, Elizabeth Richards, from 1930. It was known as Lizzie's Place until she died in 1966. It then stood empty for a number of years until my father-in-law came down looking for somewhere to retire. He was a master carpenter and was looking for planning permission to build a retirement home. He came down from Middlesex and fell in love with the spot where the railway carriage was. But Mr. Higgins said when his father-in-law applied for planning permission to build a house he was told the railway carriage had been there so long that it had “grandfather rights”. So he decided to build around it. He actually built the house with a kitchen and a lounge but the bedrooms are in the railway carriage. Mr. Higgins says that he has been working on the carriage restoration project. “It has taken a huge effort to make it as authentic as possible. Getting the right specifications was very hard. There's not a lot of information about the carriages----it would be different if it was one of the engines. For instance, getting the right color paint is a big task. It isn't something that is available in shops.” Mr. Higgins adds that he is considering opening it up to the public once it is fully restored.",

      "article": "I love listening to music and there's never been a better time to be a music fan. With so many ways to get music, we can listen to it any way we want, wherever we want. Although some fans still like to use CD players, the most popular way to listen to music nowadays is by either downloading or streaming . As Internet connections got better, more MP3s were downloaded and shared. But the sound quality of these MP3s is not so good when compared to tapes or CDs. However, new generations of music fans have grown used to this cheapened sound quality and don't mind. Streaming technology has made it even easier to listen to your favorite music. For a monthly price of about $10 (there are also free services with advertisements), users can listen to an endless amount of music from smartphones, computers and television sets. Unfortunately, streaming is not without its downsides. Because all of the music is provided online, a strong Internet connection is necessary. And although it may seem like the Internet is available everywhere, there may be situations where you don't get connected. Agreements with music companies and artists also need to be reached before streaming services are allowed to host their music. Whether you choose to download or stream music, the artist does not make much money. The low payment from downloading and streaming music has also led to the continuing increase in concert ticket prices. And we can only expect these prices to increase greatly in the future. Much as I would like to have all my music for free, I realize that it will kill the industry I've enjoyed for most of my life. I can't say for certain which is better — downloading or streaming — but I do know how I can do my little part to help musicians continue making great music. Rather than focus on one or the other, I'm going to continue doing what I've been doing since I first discovered music: listen to it any way I can.",

After the first week, I noticed that the food was eaten up very quickly. Then I began keeping an eye on my mum. To my surprise, I found that she would put some of the food into a paper bag and go out with it at about nine every morning. And finally, I decided to follow her. I saw her taking the food to the street children. She would also spend a lot of time talking and playing with them. One day, I talked to a neighbor and found out that my mum was well-known in the area. The children were very friendly with her and even thought of her as their own mother. Then it hit me – why wouldn't she want to tell me about it? Was she worried that I would stop buying food if I found out? When my mum got home, I gave her a big hug. I told her she didn't need to keep it a secret from me. And she told me something about the children. Some of them lived with an old lady in a small house. Others slept on the street. For years, she was helping the poor street children by giving them food. After she told me everything, I was so moved by how selfless she was. She helped others in need. As her son, I was so proud of my mum. I continued to buy food for my mum after that. But I always added one more bag for her other children.",

About nine years ago, UNESCO's World Cultural and Nature Heritage List had 411 places and 136 countries were responsible to protect them, and the list keeps on growing. Usually it is the task of a group of 21 experts to decide which places go on the list. The experts are chosen to work for six years. Their work is to examine and discuss the suggestions from different countries. They also manage the World Heritage Fundwhich can offer help to countries for protection work. Over the past centuries a lot of cultural or historic places have been destroyed by man or nature. Protecting our natural and cultural heritage is a long and difficult task. Earthquakes, floods, pollution, wars, or even tourism are some of the dangers that harm the heritage. When a historic place is in great danger, it is put on the World Heritage in Danger List and necessary things will be done to protect it.. Places which are on the danger list include Historic Bridges of Indiana, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Rosenwald School in Southern U.S., etc.",

Many studies have shown that multitasking doesn't work，even though your child is probably proudly claiming they can do ten things at once!Many people believe that they can perform two or more tasks meanwhile，but Dr Edward Hallowell says this is a myth. The reality is that shifting tasks results in poor job performance. 　　New devices such as smartphones，iPads，games and social networking sites make it very easy to multitask and“attention share”resulting in difficulty focusing on the task at hand，such as listening in the classroom or doing homework. “Unfortunately，the brain actually rewards kids for multitasking even though performance on every task gets worse and worse. Kids don't know that they are doing worse because they feel better when they multitask，”says Dr Edward Hallowell. 　　Since the appearance of hand-held devices and social networking sites like Facebook，teachers have noticed a difference in academic performance，critical thinking skills and how information is processed. “Multitasking prevents people from gaining a deep understanding of the infornmation they are trying to learn，”says Dr Edward Hallowell. Kids have a difficult time sticking with a“difficult to understand”topic and are more likely to allow themselves to be distracted，to tune out and switch over to Facebook or using their cell phones rather than working harder at understanding a difficult subject or problem.

      "article": "C My grandmother often said to me, “You can count the number of your true friends on the fingers of one hand.” For a long time I thought this was true. However, I've now discovered my grandmother was only half right. Maybe we do only make a few “best” friends in our lifetime, but those aren't the only people that we can call friends. There are many different types. Let me tell you about a few of them. One type of friends is the type I call the “football mom friend”. My neighbor Sally is a good example. We both have kids who play football in a football club, and someone has to take them to practice and pick them up. Sally and I and two other mothers take turns to do this. We meet sometimes and have tea and talk about what our kids are doing, but those are the only times that we meet each other. I enjoy being with these women, but we don't do anything else together. Another type is called the “hobby friend”. That's the person you share an interest or a hobby with. Michael and Cater, who are brothers, are a good example of this type. We're all in a bird watching club. Every few weekends the members of the club go on a trip to watch different kinds of birds. There's nothing romanticabout my relationship with Michael and Cater, of course. We just share interest in birds. Then there's the “other half of the couple” type of friends. Jim is married to Rose, a friend that I've known since college. When Rose married Jim, I realized that I would have to be Jim's friend if I want to continue to be Rose's. Jim and I don't share so many interests, but we do have a friendly relationship.",

      "article": "B Mum, Helen Clements, described how her fun family trip to Longleat Safari Park turned into a nightmare as their car caught fire while they were surrounded by killer beasts. The story happened when the group reached the lions' area during a visit to the park. Just as they came up to a group of 12 lions, smoke suddenly began to come out of the engine. Helen was so scared that she pressed the horn to ask for help from the park workers, but then flames started to appear. The family was then faced with the dilemma of staying inside the car away from the lions or escaping the deadly fire. Fortunately, the lions were led into a night－time enclosure by the workers as the family made their escape from the car. With the family sent to the safety of the park office, the roads were cleared of cars so the fire service could put out the fire. No one was injured in any way and no lions were hurt. Helen said that it was not the workers' fault. She said, “They were great.” Today speaking of the experience, Helen said: “Looking back at it, we can laugh, but at that very moment it was frightening. I think, Oh my goodness. Why did it happen in the lion enclosure? Why not while we were at the penguins, or the kangaroos? When the car was filled with more and more smoke and the flames were getting bigger, I was thinking about explosions, just like in films. Luckily we didn't think about the lions. The cars in front of us were kind of sheltering us from them, so we didn't really see how close they were. If we had been just 50 yards further along, it would have been a very different story.”",

      "article": "My color television has given me nothing but a headache. I was able to buy it a little over a year ago because I had my relatives give me money for my birthday instead of a lot of clothes that wouldn't fit. I let a salesclerk fool me into buying a discontinued model. I realized this a day later, when I saw newspaper advertisements for the set at seventy-five dollars less than I had paid. The set worked so beautifully when I first got it home that I would keep it on until stations signed off for the night. Fortunately, I didn't get any channels showing all-night movies or I would never have gotten to bed. Then I started developing a problem with the set that involved static noise. For some reason, when certain shows switched into a commercial, a loud noise would sound for a few seconds. Gradually, this noise began to appear during a show, and to get rid of it, I had to change to another channel and then change it back. Sometimes this technique would not work, and I had to pick up the set and shake it to remove the sound. I actually began to build up my arm muscles shaking my set. When neither of these methods removed the static noise ,I would sit helplessly and wait for the noise to go away. At last I ended up hitting the set with my fist, and it stopped working altogether.My trip to the repair shop cost me $62, and the set is working well now ,but I keep expecting more trouble.",

Kite Surfing It's the exciting mixture of kite, board and waves. The idea of using a kite to accelerate speed seems like a new challenge, yet the art of kite flying dates back to the 13th-century Chinese when it was used as a simple means of transport. Catch a wind and you're moving — up, down and across the surf. “It's always exciting. You'd jump 5 feet or 35 feet. You never know if you're going to go up in the air, and your heart is just going boom, boom, boom.” Coasteering It is by far the best activity and the event that everyone is still talking about. This is exploring the coastline without worrying about a coastal path or finding a rocky bay blocking your route. You climb, dive and swim from one place to another. With Coasteering, you don't have to be able to swim as the wet suit and buoyancy aid will keep you floating when you are in the water. Sky Diving Traditional parachuting doesn't sound risky enough. So now sky diving is the name for jumping from a plane and listening to your heart beating heavily as you move fast towards earth before you open your parachute at the last moment. Mountain Biking It's been around so long that bikers are no longer satisfied with just going up and down a mountain. Mountain biking is a sport which consists of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough land, using specially adapted mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but include features designed to improve strength and performance in rough areas.
