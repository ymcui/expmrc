      "article": "C Teenagers are going to have lessons on how to sleep. Materials to teach teenagers how to get enough sleep will be offered to schools across Scotland. The teaching created by the charity Sleep Scotland is used to be part of curriculum. It aims to help people realize the importance of sleep for young people's physical and emotional health. The charity said watching TV and using computers and mobile phones at night can prevent teenagers getting the nine hours of sleep they need. Sleep Scotland, which also offers a sleep advising service, said getting enough sleep can improve grades and physical health. However, less sleep can be connected to being heavy and a greater risk of feeling upset and hopeless. Jane Ansell, leader of Sleep Scotland, said, “I don't think any parent would think of sending out their child without enough food in the morning, or beautiful clothing, and they know how important exercise is, so why should you send your child out without enough sleep?” The charity hopes to educate young people about why they need a full night's sleep and how to develop good sleeping habits. Kate Pearce, a teacher of guidance, said, “We see it more often at third year onwards. Pupils find it very difficult to get up in the morning and pay attention to their study. Sleep is most surely a problem.” Research shows that sleep time for teenagers around the world has decreased over the past 10 to 20 years. A report by the charity said young people often believed they could make up for sleep time during the week by sleeping late at weekends. However, by going to bed even later at weekends they were actually forcing a change in their body clocks, which would influence their study on Monday mornings.",
